This coming week I hope to spend many hours working on FLT with the people who show up to my course. There are a number of projects we can work on, which I'll explain in the first lecture. Next weekend I'll figure out where we've got to and what needs doing, and then I feel like I will be able to commit to making fortnightly posts explaining what needs doing, and attempting to get some momentum going.</p>",
