Or more precisely that a certain surjective ring map <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R \\to \\mathbb{T}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">T</span></span></span></span> is an isomorphism. This is done by proving (edit: a module over?) <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{T}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">T</span></span></span></span> has an <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span>-free summand, so <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{T}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">T</span></span></span></span> is faithful, so the map is injective. This is done via a \"numerical criterion\", reducing the existence of a free summand to some inequalities involving finite abelian groups.</p>\n<p>I don't know anything else about the proof of FLT really, and I'm not a number theorist. But I am a commutative algebraist and my understanding is that the numerical criterion can be extracted into a self contained, purely commutative algebra based statement/proof. My advisor got interested in this topic a couple years ago, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08212\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08212</a>, and he said he'd be open to talking to me about the proof and helping me formalize it if there was interest.</p>\n<p>Since this seems reasonably self contained, I thought it might be worth trying to work on it now so that once the overall proof of FLT needs it it can be slotted in. Does anyone have a reason it would be a bad idea to start working on this now? Alternatively, would anyone be interested in working on this part of FLT? Certainly there is background commutative algebra that would need to be developed for this</p>",
