By applying for and getting a research grant of this kind for a formalization project, Kevin has obviously made the prospects a lot better for all those who do formalization of mathematics! We don't need people telling him how to manage his research grant, we need others who care about formalization to also do many kinds of things to advance formalization.</p>",

Of course the results we could achieve<br>\nthen are nowhere near as impressive as the recent works that you<br>\ndescribe. But even then, there was a similar pattern: With a computer<br>\nwe could go a step further than was possible by hand, and then we<br>\nwere lucky enough to see how to generize the computer's discoveries<br>\nto infinitely many larger cases.<br>\nThe paper appeared in a supplement to the American Mathematical Monthly<br>\nvolume 72 (February 1965), on pages 21--28 of a separately paged<br>\nsupplement. That supplement, entitled Computers and Computing,<br>\nwas number 10 in a series of occasional publications called the<br>\nHerbert Ellsworth Slaught Memorial Papers. (It was reprinted, with<br>\nan addendum, as Chapter 1 of my Selected Papers on Discrete Mathematics.)<br>\nBest regards, Don</p>",
