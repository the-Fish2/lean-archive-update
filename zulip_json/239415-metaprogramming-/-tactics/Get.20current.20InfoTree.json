These suggestions require elaboration information (e.g. the types of certain variables), and since the linter runs after the declaration has been elaborated, I thought we should be able to get access to the <code>InfoTree</code> nodes for the declaration and get the elab information from them. However, I couldn't immediately figure out how to get the relevant <code>InfoTree</code>(s). Any pointers?</p>",
