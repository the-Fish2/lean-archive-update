The analogous set theory statement <code>|V_k| = k</code> is true for inaccessible <code>k</code>, so I thought there might be a way to build up <code>Type 0</code> in steps and get a similar result.</p>\n<p>More generally, if all types in a universe inject into a type, does that universe inject into it? Since a universe is bigger than any one type in it, I think this is the same as asking if there are cardinalities between <code>sup #α, α : Type u</code> and <code>#(Type u)</code>.</p>",
