I've been lucky to meet an expert with whom I set up something quite informal and he's taught me a lot. I'm excited by what Lean offers but books and online tutorials seem to only get one so far, and I've missed having 1-on-1 interactions for learning since my master's ended, or at the very least someone to collaborate with. Would anyone be interested in getting on one or more calls to help me make sense of some more advanced theorems/results I'm trying to prove? There would be payment of course. If so please reach out via DM :)</p>",
