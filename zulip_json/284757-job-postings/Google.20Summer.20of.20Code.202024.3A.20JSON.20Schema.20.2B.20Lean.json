If you're a student or otherwise interested doing some open source work for the summer, feel free to have a look there and ping me with any questions. Applications first go through Google here <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/</a><br>\nThe stipend varies based on where you live, but numbers are here -- <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends\">https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends</a></p>",
