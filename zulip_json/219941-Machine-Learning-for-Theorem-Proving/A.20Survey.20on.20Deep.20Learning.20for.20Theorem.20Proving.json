Hopefully it can provide enough pointers for people who want to dig deeper into these topics. </p>\n<p>We aimed to be as comprehensive as possible, but it's possible that we still missed some important papers. You're welcome to bring them up by opening issues in our GitHub repo, and we will consider incorporating them into the next version. Thanks!</p>\n<p>arXiv: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09939\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09939</a><br>\nGitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/zhaoyu-li/DL4TP\">https://github.com/zhaoyu-li/DL4TP</a></p>",
