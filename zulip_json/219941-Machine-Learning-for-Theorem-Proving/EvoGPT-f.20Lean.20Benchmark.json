Mathematicians and computer scientists have spent decades of painstaking formalization efforts developing languages such as Coq, HOL, and Lean. Machine learning research has converged on these formal math corpora and given rise to an assortment of methodologies to aid in interactive and automated theorem proving. However, these papers have primarily focused on one method, for one proof task, in one language. This paper introduces EvoGPT-f: <strong>a novel evolutionary framework for the first systematic quantitative analysis of the differential machine learnability of five formal math corpora (Lean 3, Lean 4, Coq, HOL 4, HOL Light) using four tokenization methods (character, word-level, Byte Pair Encoding and StarCoder tokenizer)</strong>. This paper does not put to rest the question of the \"best\" or \"easiest\" language to learn. Rather, this framework and preliminary findings begin to illuminate the differential machine learnability of these languages, offering a foundation to forge more systematic quantitative and qualitative comparative research across communities.</p>",

An evolutionary framework isn't the only way to benchmark. I designed it this way because transformers are the gold-standard of language learning, so casting this in an evolutionary method and spanning  tokenization methods was a means to distill and normalize the inherent learnability of the language/formalism. Is this wording more helpful?</p>",

It leaves me wondering what is meant by \"inherent learnability\", which is what I was wondering to begin with and the reason I asked if it was being addressed in a definitional way. It sounds like there is a property of languages called learnability and that this approach is able to quantify that at least in relative terms.</p>",
