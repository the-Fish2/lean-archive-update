At the time of writing we haven't got as far as defining the modular form yet, but we have made some new types (rings) <code>ZHat</code> and <code>QHat</code>, and I've proved some API for them in LaTeX and stated it all in Lean but some proofs are missing in Lean. The exercise is a connected component in the blueprint with about twenty nodes, not connected to the large FLT component (ignore the small connected components in top right).</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/ZYJHQ_40aSUzAmV-d1Zswrm5/example.png\">example.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/ZYJHQ_40aSUzAmV-d1Zswrm5/example.png\" title=\"example.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/ZYJHQ_40aSUzAmV-d1Zswrm5/example.png\"></a></div><p>Now many of those Lean theorems were written by Github copilot (possibly including one which was originally completely wrong <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/pull/56\">FLT#56</a>). The 12 blue nodes represent situations where the statement of the theorem is written in Lean and LaTeX, and the proof is written in LaTeX but sorried in Lean. I did not try running my LaTeX proofs through any LLM to see how good they were at writing proofs of these \"basic\" number-theoretic statements.</p>\n<p>I would imagine that there will be many more times in the FLT project when there is suddenly some strong correspondence between a LaTeX blueprint file and a Lean file, except that there are places where the LaTeX has a proof and the Lean has a sorry. The example above is saying that <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/8764e28f03cd0d03f673e1288f47fc7a665207de/blueprint/src/chapter/ch05automorphicformexample.tex\">this LaTeX file</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/8764e28f03cd0d03f673e1288f47fc7a665207de/FLT/AutomorphicRepresentation/Example.lean\">this Lean file</a> correspond in a strong way, and the question is how many sorries can an LLM remove autonomously, possibly after some interaction with a Lean server.</p>",
