The next PR on top of this one, <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/7162\">#7162</a> almost has an easier diff to read because with each theorem added about <code>Identical</code>, the corresponding theorem about <code>Relabelling</code> is deleted, so it's easy to see that the API surface isn't really increasing. Is there general guidance about whether adding a replacement and deleting the old thing should be combined into one PR or split?</p>",
