These are very important in additive combinatorics, so would be good to get this merged, once people are happy with the Lean of it all.</p>\n<p>(To clarify: this PR moves definitions from <code>Algebra.Group.Freiman</code> to <code>Combinatorics.Additive.FreimanHom</code> and does some other Lean refactoring. I am not at all testifying about whether these changes are right or appropriate, which is more of a Lean issue - I'm just vouching that the definitions as they stand now are correct mathematically, and also that given the importance of Freiman homomorphisms it would be good to get people to look at this and merge it when done.)</p>",
