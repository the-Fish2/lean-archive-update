(I may look at proving regular+second countable implies psuedometrizable in the future.)</li>\n<li>Introducing the lemma <code>countable_covers_to_separated_nhds</code> which can also be used to prove that perfectly normal spaces are completely normal (once perfectly normal spaces are defined).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What I ain't proud of: the terrible duplication in my proofs. My proofs could probably be cut nearly in half but I will need guidance on how to best avoid repeating the same argument twice and instead loop through the same argument with different inputs.</p>",
