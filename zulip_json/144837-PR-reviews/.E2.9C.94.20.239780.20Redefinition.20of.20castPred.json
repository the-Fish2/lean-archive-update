But that's a separate matter.</p>\n<p>This relates to <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9145\">#9145</a>, but reading that PR or its discussion thread is not necessary for discussing this PR. It splits off one of that PR's components to reduce the size of its diff.</p>",
