It is the last prerequisite for a satisfactory uniqueness result for Haar measures in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9909\">#9909</a>. I realize that it's probably a little bit hard to review as it's not completely standard material -- but the upshot is that once <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9909\">#9909</a> is in we will have stronger uniqueness results for the Haar measure than in any textbook or article I know of, which is quite nice!</p>",
