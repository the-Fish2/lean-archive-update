Feel free to offer concrete suggestions though (in the shape of the same table as in the PR description with the three subrows collapsed if you want <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it's a bit unfortunate that in the new naming scheme the <code>GroupWithZero</code> lemmas don't have the \"default name\" anymore, since they are the more commonly used ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This decision largely predates this PR. The <code>₀</code> is better because if lemma <code>X</code> doesn't apply to your situation, then you can always add <code>₀</code> and try again. In comparison, primes are overloaded, so there's no guarantee you will hit the correct lemma by adding <code>'</code>.</p>",
