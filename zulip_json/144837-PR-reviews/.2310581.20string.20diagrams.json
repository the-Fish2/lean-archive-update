The former expression should be rewritten to the latter by the <code>eval</code> program, which is called before drawing the diagram.</p>\n<p>The problem was that lean can't find implicit arguments when using <code>mkAppM</code> (e.g. it can't find a <code>Category C</code> instance). This problem only happened when <code>eval</code> is called in the widget program, and there was no problem in the test code that called <code>eval</code> alone. I don't understand why this happens, but I removed all <code>mkAppM</code> and then the program works.</p>",
