(By Mathlib's conventions this should probably be called <code>lSeries</code> or even <code>lseries</code>, but the capital <code>L</code> is standard in informal math so an exception has been made; that's not the question here).</p>\n<p>Now, PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11214\">#11214</a> adds lemmas about the linearity properties of <code>LSeries</code> in the <code>ℕ → ℂ</code> argument. What should these be called? Am I correct in believing that <code>LSeries.add</code>, <code>LSeries.smul</code> would be discouraged, since this is not a situation where dot-notation makes sense?</p>",

Sage modular form objects have had a method <code>cuspform_lseries</code> for years and nobody seems to have been bothered by it (at least, not enough to change it). But the capitalisation of <code>LSeries</code> is not the question here (it is not a new declaration introduced in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11214\">#11214</a> so it is irrelevant to the reviewing of that PR).</p>",
