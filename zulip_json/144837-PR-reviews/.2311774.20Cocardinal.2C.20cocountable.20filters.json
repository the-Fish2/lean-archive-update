        "content": "<p>Hi, could someone take a brief look at this PR? Reviewing should be short (120-ish lines, nothing particularly scary). It defines cocardinal and cocountable filters analogous to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Cofinite#doc\">docs#Cofinite</a> and proves some basic facts about them. (In particular, that every cocardinal filter is a <code>CardinalInterFilter</code> with the corresponding cardinality). I can prove some more facts on them (analogous to what happens for <code>cofinite</code>), but I'd like to first get this merged or get some green light on the way everything is structured before putting more time in this!</p>",
