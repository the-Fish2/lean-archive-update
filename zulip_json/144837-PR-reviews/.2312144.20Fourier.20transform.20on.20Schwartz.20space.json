It's way too big for a single PR, so I've already split 7 PRs out of it. Among these, the one that is the most blocking for further PRs is the short <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12150\">#12150</a>, which I need to give an explicit definition of the iterated derivative of multilinear maps (bounds on derivatives of multilinear maps are useful to derive explicit estimates on derivatives of the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function).</p>\n<p>Note that <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12150\">#12150</a> encounters issues with typeclass inference around complicated spaces of continuous linear maps, an issue that we have already met several times. I have a silly workaround (register the problematic instance in a specific def, and activate it as a local instance where needed), but if anyone (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"306577\">@Matthew Ballard</span> ?) has better ideas, I'm all ears!</p>",
