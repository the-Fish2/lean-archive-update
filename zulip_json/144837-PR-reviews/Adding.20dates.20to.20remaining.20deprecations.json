But let's get these reviewed first :-)</p>\n<p>(Once <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/pull/3968\">lean4#3968</a> is available in mathlib, one can mass-convert these dates into readable form, and a metaprogramm could automatically delete declarations which have been deprecated for a long time.)</p>",
