I also state the smooth Poincaré conjecture as a <code>def</code>, since it's not often true. As bonuses, I also state the existence of an exotic 7-sphere and a small exotic R^4. Please check if I made any mistakes! And should these be in Archive instead?</p>\n<p>I'm not sure whether the T2Space assumption is necessary; could a non-Hausdorff manifold have the same homotopy type as a sphere? <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/25472/fundamental-group-of-the-line-with-the-double-origin\">Here</a> are some discussions about a non-Hausdorff 1-manifold.</p>",
