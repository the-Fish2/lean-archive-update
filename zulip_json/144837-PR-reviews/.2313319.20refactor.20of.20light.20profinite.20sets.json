        "content": "<p>This PR refactors the definition of light profinite sets to bring it closer to that of profinite sets. It becomes the category of totally disconnected second countable compact Hausdorff spaces. The old definition changes name to <code>LightDiagram</code> and we give an equivalence of categories. </p>\n<p>These changes don't break anything currently in mathlib or in PRs about light condensed sets. Furthermore it makes a number of things easier, namely the construction of countable limits in <code>LightProfinite</code> and a discreteness characterisation for light condensed sets. </p>\n<p>In the future, we might further refactor the definitions of <code>CompHaus</code>, <code>Profinite</code>, <code>LightProfinite</code> and <code>Stonean</code> to unify them in some sort of <code>CompHausLike</code> structure, but it's not quite clear how that would look exactly. In any case the refactor in this PR will make that future change cleaner.
