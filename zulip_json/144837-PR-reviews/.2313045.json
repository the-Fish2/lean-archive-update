I disagreed on the basis this had nothing to do with <code>v4.9.0</code> except that the warning, that should have been generated all along, would actually be generated.</p>\n<p>My take is that <code>set_option linter.deprecated</code> is sufficient flag for this sort of defect, and there's no need for an additional <code>#adaptation_note</code>, which should be about changes in Lean.</p>\n<p>Disagreements, if any, can go here, and I'll update files as necessary!</p>",
