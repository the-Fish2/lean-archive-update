This is a step towards the definition of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space, which will probably be relevant for PNT (although I am doing it in proper generality, which is probably overkill for PNT). It is too big to be reviewed directly, but for now I have split off 4 bits that should be quite reasonable.</p>",
