I think the reason why they weren't <code>@[simp]</code> before is because the simp normal forms are currently bifurcated. There is one set of lemmas for <code>eval</code>, and another set for <code>evalFrom</code>, and they don't reduce to each other. It seems like there's a pending discussion on whether we should unify them or not.</p>\n<p>Rather than try to address that question now, how about we punt that to a future PR? The bifurcation problem is preexisting and so I don't think we need to fix it here.</p>\n<p>cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span></p>",
