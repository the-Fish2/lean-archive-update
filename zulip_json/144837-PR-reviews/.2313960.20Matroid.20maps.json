From the PR description: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This PR creates a new file with the machinery for transferring matroid structures between types. The most important definitions are <code>Matroid.map</code>, which pushes a <code>M : Matroid α</code> along <code>f : α → β</code> to give an <code>N : Matroid β</code>, and<br>\n<code>Matroid.comap</code>, which pulls <code>N : Matroid β</code> back along <code>f : α → β</code> to get an <code>M : Matroid α</code>. The former requires <code>f</code> to be injective on the ground set of <code>E</code>, but the latter doesn't.</p>\n<p>The decision to define matroids with an embedded ground set within a type rather than just a structure on a type came with tradeoffs, and it is in places like this that they show up the most. For this reason, the file also defines several variants of <code>map</code> where the range/domain of the function in question is a coerced set rather than a type.</p>\n<p>There is nothing mathematically interesting going on with these definitions, and maps and comaps are not central to matroid theory in actual research, but they are very useful in making formalization painless, as they save the work of painstakingly proving matroid axioms in many cases. They will be used in future PRs to define things like direct sums and linearly representable matroids. </p>\n</blockquote>",
