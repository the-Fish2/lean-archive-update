We then updated this PR on <time datetime=\"2024-04-14T22:00:00Z\">2024-04-15T00:00:00+02:00</time>  to try and match the planned refactor  by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"321459\">@Damiano Testa</span> , see discussion <a href=\"#narrow/stream/287929-mathlib4/topic/Separate.20.60Finsupp.60.20from.20.60AddMonoidAlgebra.60/near/421624155\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I wanted to ask here whether there are any news regarding a review? The shape of this work is important for upcoming work. In particular, we wish to define <code>SkewPolynomial</code>. We have ideas where to go from there but this is assuming no major change to the current version of <code>SkewMonoidAlgebra</code>. In other words: It would be nice to have a review before we continue.</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot!<br>\nXavier</p>",

I then started a merge of the two with a <code>to_additive</code> like tool for getting them to work in parallel, but that will probably take a long time to be reviewed.</p>\n<p>The conclusion is that your PR should not depend implicitly or explicitly on the <code>(Add)MonoidAlgebra</code> refactor.</p>",
