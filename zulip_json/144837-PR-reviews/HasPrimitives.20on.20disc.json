We have an approach that upgrades this to holomorphic functions having primitives on simply connected domains. (Then we'll have complex logs on the latter, square-roots, and, thanks to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"242586\">@Vincent Beffara</span>'s work, the Riemann Mapping Theorem...) Any comments/suggestions welcome!</p>",
