One exception is <code>Basis.flag_span_succ</code>: upon reviewing <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/11264\">#11264</a> (which submitted this upstream), <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"111080\">@Floris van Doorn</span> pointed out this looks very similar to <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=Basis.flag_succ#doc\">docs#Basis.flag_succ</a>.</p>\n<p>Indeed, both have virtually the same hypotheses (some implicit arguments have different order), but their conclusion differs slightly.<br>\n<code>flag_succ</code> has conclusion <code>Basis.flag b (Fin.succ k) = span R {b k} ⊔ Basis.flag b (Fin.castSucc k)</code>,<br>\n<code>flag_span_succ</code> has conclusion <code>Basis.flag b (Fin.succ k) = span R {b k} ⊔ Basis.flag b ↑↑k</code> (coercing <code>k</code> to <code>Fin k+1</code>, I believe).</p>\n<p>Changing this requires some routine changes and some refactor of <code>Local/HPrinciple</code>: I tried and can't do it without digging deeper into the code. (I can push a WIP branch somewhere if people are interested.)</p>\n<p>Is this difference intentional? Was this simple a design which was improved later, in mathlib? Or should the other version be added?</p>",
