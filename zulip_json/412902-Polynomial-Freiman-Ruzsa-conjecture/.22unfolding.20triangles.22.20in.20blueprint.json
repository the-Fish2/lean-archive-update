It was the other way around in sphere eversion or LTE IIRC. I talked to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296911\">@Utensil Song</span> about this and they seem to have got to the bottom of the problem. Is this something worth fixing? I was just looking at the blueprint again when trying to understand what Sebastian has just done changing a 22 to a 12 and I noticed this again.</p>",
