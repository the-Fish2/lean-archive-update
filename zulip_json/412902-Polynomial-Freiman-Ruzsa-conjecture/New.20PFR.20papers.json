T. Gowers, Ben Green, Freddie Manners, Terence Tao - extends PFR to odd characteristic </li>\n<li>\"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09639\">Improved Exponent for Marton's Conjecture inÂ Fn2</a>, Jyun-Jie Liao - improves the PFR exponent in characteristic 2 further, from 11 to 9.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jyun-Jie Liao and I have agreed to try working on formalizing these results, possibly starting in a month or so with an update of the blueprint.  Stay tuned!</p>",
