Moreover, it did not understand follow-up questions and just interpreted them as new questions without context (as far as I can tell) which made it hard to specify/correct things.</p>\n<p>I don't know how they work behind the scene, but <a href=\"https://www.moogle.ai\">moogle</a> and <a href=\"https://loogle.lean-lang.org/\">loogle</a> are two great lean-related AI tools, which are useful to explore the most recent version of mathlib, and maybe there are synergies there that could be used.</p>",
