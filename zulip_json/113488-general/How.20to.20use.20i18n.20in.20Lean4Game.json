How can I use the lean-i18n to generate the Chinese version of NNG4, though I know there are some front-end codes not ready. But I can also code js or ts. So maybe I can help. I can also program in Lean, but know little meta programming unfortunately.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JiechengZhao/NNG4/tree/main/.i18n\">https://github.com/JiechengZhao/NNG4/tree/main/.i18n</a> </p>\n<p>I really hope that more Chinese users can play the lean games.</p>",

If you wanted to help implement that, first thing is adding a npm module which supports using PO files. I think <code>i18next</code> or <code>react-intl</code> are canonical choices for internationalisation packages, but that's where I lack experience (and why I did other stuff instead).</p>\n<p>Once that's set-up it should be easy to use the translation everywhere in the game.</p>",
