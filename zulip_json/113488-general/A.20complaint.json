And then someone moved the discussion to a hidden channel so no-one can see it. (It will not appear in when searching for it in the search bar.) And then subscribed myself and one other person to that channel.</p>\n<p>This evening I spent several hours crafting a post which I posted there only to realise this is now a hidden channel so it was a big waste of my time. I only realised it was shadow banned by logging into a new account to check.</p>\n<p>That is fine. I understand that maybe it is annoying if notifications appear on discussions they are not interested in. But please next time someone does this can they make it clear that they have moved it from a public channel to a hidden channel.  Because this is more-or-less the same as shadow banning discussions which is not very cool. <br>\nA more sensible solution would be to move it to another public channel in which people can turn off notifications.</p>\n<p>This is also counter productive because by hiding discussions, it means people will re-implement things several times over which is a waste of brain power for the world.</p>\n<p>Thanks for listening.</p>",
