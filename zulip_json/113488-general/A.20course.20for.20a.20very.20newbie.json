I completed the Natural Number Game designed by Kevin Buzzard and read some articles about what Lean is.</p>\n<p>Now, I’m planning to formalize my mathematical work in combinatorics and representation theory. Given that I have only a little knowledge of Lean, what should I do first to ensure the success of my project? Additionally, I’m interested in using the blueprint tool developed by Patrick Massot.</p>\n<p>Any guidance on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!</p>",
