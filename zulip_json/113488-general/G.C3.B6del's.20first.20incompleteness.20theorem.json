Is this a realistic endeavor? His repository logic4-lean has 10K lines of code--so should the emphasis be on extracting minimal proofs that integrate tightly with mathlib's code on model theory etc? As suggested by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"310045\">@Eric Wieser</span> he has separated some coprime theorems <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9005\">#9005</a> from Godel's Beta Function <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8887\">#8887</a>, and his proof also depends on <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8619\">#8619</a> which you have seen.   </p>\n<p>Second, what would represent a minimum viable pull request on complexity theory? My PR <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8931\">#8931</a> has definitions of P, NP, NP-Completeness, and poly time reductions, without theorems. I could readily add an example of a language in P and NP, consisting of every bit string, with a TM that returns \"[true]\" on any input. Going further eg an example of NP completeness would require universal TM via bounded halting, and Cook Levin is even harder. Showing that poly time reducibility is transitive would require composability of TMs. After rereading three years of discussions and seeing all the failed PRs, I wanted to understand what is needed for a successful PR before investing more time.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",

This PR is again definition heavy and lacking theorems. My thought was to focus on either (1) showing that the definition of polynomial time computation coincides across the TM definitions, ie. the emulations are poly time (and show the TM0 and TM quintet definition emulate each other); or (2) show that TM computations under the quintet definition can be composed, and the composition of two polynomial time computations is also poly time. Any thoughts?</p>",
