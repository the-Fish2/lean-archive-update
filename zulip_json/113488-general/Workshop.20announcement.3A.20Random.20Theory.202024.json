        "content": "<p>Hi folks!  My name is Colin McSwiggen and I'm a postdoc at NYU's Courant Institute.  Together with Semon Rezchikov at IAS, I co-organize an annual workshop series called Random Theory, which takes place this year from August 13-19 in Estes Park, Colorado.  We host 8-15 researchers with distinct but adjacent interests in math, physics and/or computer science, and we invite them to present unsolved problems from their own research, with the goal of beginning new collaborations in order to make meaningful research progress during the event.  Attendees have found this model quite helpful for advancing their work: since last year’s workshop, 7 of the 8 participants have coauthored papers based on new collaborations begun there.  You can find more information on the website: <a href=\"http://cosmc.net/rt24/\">http://cosmc.net/rt24/</a>  </p>\n<p>I wanted to advertise this event to the Lean community because this year we would particularly like to invite at least a few people working on AI/ML for formal reasoning.  If you think you might be interested in participating, please take a look at the website and fill out the interest form linked there!  Please also feel free to send the link to anyone else who you think might benefit from an event like this, whether or not they work on formal reasoning.</p>",
