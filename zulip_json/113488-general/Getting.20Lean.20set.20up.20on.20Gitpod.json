Currently, the workspace doesn't build my changes when I reopen the workspace, so <code>lake</code> and <code>elan</code> cannot be found. However, these can be found when I run <code>gp validate</code>, except that now, <code>docker</code> cannot be found. </p>\n<p>Additionally, Gitpod doesn't like me creating a Lean project within an existing Gitpod project, and the Lean Infoviewer seems to be completely blank when opened in the debugger workspace, complaining that the Gitpod project I have opened is not a valid Lean project. This occurs after I create a new Lean project within the Gitpod project, run <code>gp validate</code>, and then open a Lean file.</p>\n<p>I haven't used Docker before and want to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid, so apologies if these questions seem too rudimentary!
