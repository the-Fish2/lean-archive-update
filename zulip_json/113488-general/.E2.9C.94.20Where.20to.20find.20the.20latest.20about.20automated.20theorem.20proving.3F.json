There's also a lot of software verification stuff at the big programming language conferences, POPL and PLDI. Excellent groups in the US include, off the top of my hat, those of Andrew Appel, Adam Chlipala,  Benjamin Pierce, Stephanie Weirich, Steve Zdancewic and of course our Jeremy Avigad, but there are a lot more.</p>",
