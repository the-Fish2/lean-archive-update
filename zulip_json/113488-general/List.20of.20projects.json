As well as being a showcase of the sort of things that have been done in Lean, they may well be a useful source of material to update and add to mathlib, or of ideas for future projects. So maybe an update of that page for Lean 4 shouldn't necessarily remove the old projects (although the table of supported Lean 3 versions for each project could perhaps go away), but rather (a) add lots more projects (active or otherwise) and (b) add key metadata such as \"is this a community formalization project?\", \"is this project active?\" (or \"last commit date\") and \"what is the status of merging material from this project to mathlib, if it might be appropriate to do so?\".</p>",
