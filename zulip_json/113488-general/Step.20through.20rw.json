When I encounter a rw tactic, I can only see the state before and after applying all of the steps in the rw rule sequence. Is there a way to step through with more granularity? I have resorted to closing the square brackets early and commenting out the rest of the line, but this feels a bit hacky. I am using the emacs mode.</p>",
