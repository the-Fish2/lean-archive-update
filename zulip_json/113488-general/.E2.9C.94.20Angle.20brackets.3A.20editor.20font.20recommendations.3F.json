I'm not using a lot of Unicode, but who knows in the future, so doing well with other math symbols is obviously a plus.  \"Font with easily distinguishable angle brackets\" is not a useful web search string. :-)</p>",

Good to have additional options--I've installed both now.  I agree about Iosevka's angle brackets.  In my editor at my normal font size, the angle brackets in JuliaMono aren't as distinguishable as I'd like, but I might use it for something else.  I figured out yesterday that I can set a different font for Lean in vim/neovim using e.g. <code>autocmd filetype lean set guifont=JetBrains\\ Mono\\ NL:h13</code>.</p>",
