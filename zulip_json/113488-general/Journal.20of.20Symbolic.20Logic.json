        "content": "<p>As of January 1, 2024, I am an editor of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. I will handle submissions related to formal verification and automated reasoning, as well as their applications to mathematics. I am no longer actively working in mathematical logic, so I am not the right editor to handle papers in proof theory, model theory, computability theory, or set theory.</p>\n<p>Articles in the JSL are expected to have traditional mathematical content, so the journal is not a good place to report on formalization per se. But mathematical insights that emerge from formalizations, such as novel representations of objects and structures or new proofs of mathematical results, are in scope. So are decision procedures, search procedures, proof systems, and symbolic calculi for mathematical reasoning, especially if they have been implemented and shown to be mathematically useful.</p>\n<p>So please send good articles my way!</p>",
