Two of them were merged, so I got merge conflicts and to solve them I merged the corresponding branches, therefore the changes made by these old PRs still appear in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/12519\">#12519</a>. Should I leave it like this, or should I merge master into my branch (or do something else)?</p>",
