But they have a more regular schedule of release. Typically there are two releases every year, one in April and one around October. Every fourth release (16.04, 18.04, 20.04, and 22.04) is usually a long term support release (in the sense of providing package updates and security updates for five years). The others are more fast moving releases, which get maintenance for a shorter period of time.</p>",

There will be a version in Ubuntu's package repositories and you will still be able to install it using <code>apt</code>. It will just be version 1.85. You can still run  lean on it as long as the extension supports this version of vscode.</p>",
