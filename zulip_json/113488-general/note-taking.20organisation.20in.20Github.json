I've tried Notion but I'm not happy with the fact that it does not really support offline and does not integrate nicely with code on my device. </p>\n<p>As a solution, I'm thinking of putting my notes in a private Github repo and using VS Code as my note-taking environment, so that I can easily link to/integrate snippets of math/Julia code/Lean code/text. (In terms of work-flow, I'm a PhD candidate in Financial Math, so I'm writing notes in LaTex and programming in Julia (in VS Code). I also do some Lean programming in my spare time, and would like to integrate this in my note-taking workflow as much as possible!</p>\n<p>Does anyone have experience with this/have pointers to an approach that is suitable for LaTeX, Julia and Lean?</p>",
