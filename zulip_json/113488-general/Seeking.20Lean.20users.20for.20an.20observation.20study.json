I often have the impression that we (FRO and community) try hard to improve the usability of lean, but we do so often based on gut feeling and anecdotal evidence. I don't know how much of that is part of the design of the study, but would hope we get some useful insight out for how we can further improve lean UX. Therefore I hope many of you will take part!<br>\n(Conflict of interest disclaimer: I did my post doc at that group and think they and what they are do are pretty cool :-))</p>",

Most \"Lean/Mathlib\" talks are about what people have managed to prove, not really how they got from one line to the next, what their \"tricks\" were for finding the right theorem names, or big picture approaches, etc. By contrast, I've sat through thousands of hours of mathematicians explaining how such and such theory is built, and working through explicit examples... I keep thinking that more people should just be posting their Lean sessions to YouTube; I think that would be more valuable than how it sounds... (I tried to do a (very) little bit of that, e.g., <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5GkisJ0OImg\">here</a>, it would be great to have more...)</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"5GkisJ0OImg\" href=\"https://youtu.be/5GkisJ0OImg\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/7f52fab08a18c78402f02f13b9edd93f902cd7bd/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f35476b69734a304f496d672f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
