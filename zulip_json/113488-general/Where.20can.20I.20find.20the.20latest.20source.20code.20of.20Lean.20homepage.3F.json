The Lean 4 home page as of now has little to nothing to translate, mostly only the various resources it links to are worth translating. One exception is the blog posts authored in Verso, which I hope to become in public repo one day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/\">The community website</a> has many things worth translating, but it's also updated frequently, one issue is that you need to be able to detect changes of each page and request translators to catch up.</p>",
