I did consider that earlier, I recall now, but I don't see any mention of an <code>import</code> or <code>open</code> in this section of the book.  This section is labeled as an \"interlude\", so it's not really a continuation of earlier sections.  I think it's the first place where <code>simp</code> or <code>theorem</code> is mentioned, or at least seriously presented, so I think it's unlikely that the relevant <code>import</code> is to be carried over from an earlier section.</p>",
