If so, I couldn't find it.</p>\n<p>As a test, I went to the main site, navigated easily to the install instructions (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/macos.html</a>), and I see this:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/9n_Zv-UPuBOdBdrV-UVnTkYK/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\nFirst there's a big warning that you have to trust us and that we promise we won't do anything nefarious to your system. (Only people who do nefarious things say that!...) Then there are scary unfamiliar words like <code>elan</code> and <code>sudo</code>, and you have to open a terminal; I think this is already where you'll lose the vast majority of mathematicians who want to try it on their own (even ones who have already successfully played something like the Natural Numbers Game online). Yes, there are lots of suggestions along the way for anyone to \"just\" come to zulip and ask for help; but I think people underestimate just how frightening that proposition is, even for established researchers...
