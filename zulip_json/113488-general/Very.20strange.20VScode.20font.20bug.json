Changing the font family doesn't help, and this happens on more than one computer (both VSCode on mac). </p>\n<p>It is only a display problem (the symbols parse and copy/paste correctly), but is annoying for readability. <br>\nDoes anyone know what might be going on? </p>\n<p>If others are also having this problem, I think I'll just make a PR to change the dual symbol to a different flavour of star.</p>",
