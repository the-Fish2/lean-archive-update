For example <code>Discrete</code> is defined as a structure, and I feel it should be used in a very similar way. I need to develop some API for <code>LocallyDiscrete</code> anyways, because I need to move between a category <code>C</code> and <code>LocallyDiscrete C</code> a lot when defining the fibered category associated to a pseudofunctor (valued in <code>Cat</code>). Would it be a good idea to also make it a structure then?</p>",
