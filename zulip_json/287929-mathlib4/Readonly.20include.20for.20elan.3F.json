I am always afraid when I do this that I will not notice and break something, and I never personally want to edit these files anyway. </p>\n<p>I propose putting <code>**/.elan/**</code> into a <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_79#_readonly-mode\">readonly include list</a> in the mathlib workspace settings VSCode settings.json - this would make the files here uneditable unless the user explicitly undoes in in their user settings. This seems to me like a good way to make it clear to someone who might not otherwise realize it that if you navigate to one of these files you have left mathlib.</p>",
