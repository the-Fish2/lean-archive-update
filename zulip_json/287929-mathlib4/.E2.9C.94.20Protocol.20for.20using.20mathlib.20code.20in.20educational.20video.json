I believe mathlib4 is released under Apache 2.0, but I'm not too sure of the implications for simply showing the code, rather than using it in software. There are also Microsoft copy rights at the header of each page, so I thought I'd ask to see if anyone knew how I should go about using this code. Thanks :D</p>",
