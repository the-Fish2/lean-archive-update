When searching, e.g. for \"CoAlgebra\" the result-list does not even list anything that has \"coalgebra\" in its name. When searching for \"Coalgebra\" one finds a plethora of results. Is case-sensitivity a conscious choice, or would it be an improvement no to be case-sensitive (I prefer abandoning case-sensitivity).<br>\nThanks for all the great work! I am quite impressed!</p>",
