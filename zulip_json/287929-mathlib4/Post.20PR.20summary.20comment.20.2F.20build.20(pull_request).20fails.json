I tried to merge master, but I think I screwed up. All the recent changes to Mathlib are being treated as part of my PR, which now says that it's changing 2,215 files. I tried reverting the last merge, which didn't fix that. But strangely, it now passes CI, despite the fact that I was trying to revert to a version that failed. </p>\n<p>I think it's time to admit that I don't know what I'm doing. Help!</p>",

I think it's easiest if you create a new PR from this and then tell us if you are missing stuff on that new branch. But I could only see two relevant commits on the old branch, where there more?</p>\n<p>If there are still missing  commits, you might be able to understand better what happened by digging through <code>git reflog</code> on your local machine, but that's wee technical.</p>\n<p>I think you could theoretically force-push the correct state to the PR's old branch to recover, but that's highly dangerous as a wrong step leads to unrecoverable loss, so creating a new PR from that new branch seems indeed the safer and better option. You addressed all review comments already, so it's not too much of a loss if they don't appear, and you can always link to the broken PR in the new one.</p>",
