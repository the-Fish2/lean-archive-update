I'm a bit confused by this. I'll try to fix it in a bit, but my visual-studio code is stuck as I have a little Git merge problem on another branch (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Git.20merge.20problem/near/413121779\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/113489-new-members/topic/Git.20merge.20problem/near/413121779</a>). I guess the obvious fix would be e.g. importing <code>Probability/ProbabilityMassFunction/Basic</code>, but it feels a bit weird that that would be necessary for this file, while it wasn't necessary for the Poisson distribution... (I can't really imagine that any of the other imports of the Poisson distribution would require something that imports the PMF...)</p>",
