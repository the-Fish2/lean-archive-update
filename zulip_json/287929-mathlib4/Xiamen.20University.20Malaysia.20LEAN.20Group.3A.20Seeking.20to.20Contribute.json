On behalf of our group, I will introducing our <strong>LEAN Group</strong> from the Department of Mathematics at Xiamen University Malaysia.</p>\n<p>Our group includes three undergraduate students who have been into mathematical formalization and proofs since August 2023, and our supervisor Dr. Ma Jiajiun. In less than a year, we've tackled major sections of game theory formalization with some accomplishments.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Highlights of Our Work</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Completed Tasks</strong><br>\n<strong>- Auction Theory</strong>: Including formalized proofs on no-dominant strategies in first-price auctions, the DSIC (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatible) mechanisms, and non-negative utility in second-price auctions.<br>\n<strong>- Myerson's Lemma</strong>: Optimal auctions addressing a wide range of auction design problems for sellers.<br>\n<strong>- Topological Standard Simplex is Compact</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Work-in-Progress:</strong><br>\n<strong>- Minimax Theorem</strong>: Von Neumann's foundational theory in game theory and mathematical economics.</p>\n<p><strong>Planned Tasks:</strong><br>\n<strong>- Loomis' Theorem</strong><br>\n<strong>- Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem</strong><br>\n<strong>- Nash's Existence Theorem</strong></p>\n<p>We are now looking to create a new branch where we can contribute our formalized codes to Mathlib.</p>\n<p>We would be thrilled to discuss this initiative with the community and explore possibilities for collaboration and support. Please feel free to respond here.</p>\n<p>Our repository: <a href=\"https://gitee.com/hoxide/zerosum\">zerosum: This is an open-source project dedicated to providing a foundation of game theory concepts in Lean 4. (gitee.com)</a></p>\n<p>We are excited about the opportunity to grasp the spark and grow with you guys. <span aria-label=\"smiley\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f603\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiley\">:smiley:</span></p>",

I believe that the task of proving theorems in game theory is a serious mathematical endeavor. A key resource guiding our efforts is the textbook \"Mathematical Foundations of Game Theory\" by Rida Laraki, Jerome Renault, and Sylvain Sorin, is what we are working with. You can access this textbook here for a deeper understanding of the mathematical theorems we strive to formalize.<br>\n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26646-2\">https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26646-2</a></p>",

This is also our plan. Before the actual proof, one has to build some part of the theory of abstract simplicial complex. This is a group of students at the National University of Singapore working on it now.</p>",
