As for <code>leanup</code>, I wouldn't worry too much about it until we have a working system, because all of this will be considered \"historical data\" from leanup's perspective and we'll do the best we can with whatever is available. (<code>leanup</code> will probably make use of <code>#align</code> and <code>#align_import</code> to track renames and splits in historical data, because it's been around for a while and is relatively accurate.)</p>",
