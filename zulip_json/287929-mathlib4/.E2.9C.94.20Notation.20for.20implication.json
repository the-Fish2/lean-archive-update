In that case, wouldn't it be more appropriate to use the notation of <code>HImp</code> for implication instead of <code> ⟹ </code>?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is dissatisfaction with notation both <code> ⟹ </code> for firt-order logic and the notation <code> ⇨ </code> for <code>HImp</code>. This is because the double arrow is conventionally used for meta-logical implication (see, for example, <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2336918/what-is-the-difference-between-implication-symbols-rightarrow-and-rightarr\">this</a>), so I think it should not be used in formalized logics like first-order logic or Heyting algebras (despite the meta-logical implication being represented as <code> → </code> in lean4). For instance, what about using <code> ➝ </code> for the formalized logic implication? I would like to hear everyone's opinions on this.</p>",
