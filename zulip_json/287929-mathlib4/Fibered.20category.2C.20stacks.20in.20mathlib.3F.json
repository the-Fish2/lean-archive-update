There was some discussion here (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Formalizing.20stacks\">https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Formalizing.20stacks</a>) about this. We're currently working towards improving our definitions and API following suggestions that were made in that topic, and proving a version of the 2-Yoneda lemma. We do plan on PRing that stuff to mathlib once we think it's ready.</p>",
