Or you could work in a namespace.<br>\nProbably the best option is not to give the type <code>Fin n → ℝ </code> a name at all though, or if you do to make it an <code>abbrev</code> rather than a <code>def</code>. As that way you will be able to more easily make use of results concerning <code> Fin n → ℝ</code>  that are already in mathlib.</p>",
