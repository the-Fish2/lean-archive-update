See <a href=\"https://remydegenne.github.io/CLT/index.html\">https://remydegenne.github.io/CLT/index.html</a> for the blueprint, <a href=\"https://github.com/RemyDegenne/CLT\">https://github.com/RemyDegenne/CLT</a> for the github repository and <a href=\"https://remydegenne.github.io/CLT/dep_graph_document.html\">https://remydegenne.github.io/CLT/dep_graph_document.html</a> for the dependency graph. I have added my characteristic function code to that repository.</p>\n<p>If anyone wants to contribute to the CLT proof, feel free to fork the repository and then open a PR!<br>\nThe blueprint is very much WIP: it is not yet very detailed and many proofs are missing in the latex. I'll continue working on it, and PRs for that aspect of the project are also welcome.
