And then once I have results, if I delete <code>Data.</code> and go back to <code>import Mathlib.&lt;tab&gt;</code> I also get results, again after a little while. But they look clearly incomplete.</p>\n<p>(For <code>Std&lt;tab&gt;</code> it takes ~3 seconds on my machine, which is obviously a lot smaller than Mathlib, but still isn't instant.)</p>",
