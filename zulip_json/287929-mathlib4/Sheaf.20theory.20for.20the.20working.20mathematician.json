How do I get my hands on the unique continuous function <code>F : X  → Y</code> whose restriction to each <code>U i</code> is <code>f i</code>?</p>\n<p>The existence and uniqueness of this <code>F</code>, of course, exactly the statement that continuous functions form a sheaf. So is there a simple way of extracting this concrete statement from all the general machinery of sites and coverages etc?</p>\n<p>I'm asking because I'm pretty sure I've proved several special instances of this by hand before in mathlib – e.g. in defining the Gamma function, you first give some formula that works for <code>-n &lt; re s</code> for each <code>n : ℕ</code>, and then you patch them together (so you even have an <em>increasing</em> open cover). I'm curious whether there's now a \"morally sound\" way of doing this.</p>",
