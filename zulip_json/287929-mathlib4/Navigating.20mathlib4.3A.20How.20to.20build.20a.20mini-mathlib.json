I understand that extracting a mini-mathlib4 is indeed challenging for me. As a student majoring in AI, my original intention in extracting a small subset of mathlib4 is to conduct AI research within a specific and well-defined mathematical domain. Especially I believe it is really hard for an AI theorem prover to perform effectively across all math domains.</p>",
