However, the ported version of both now use <code>DecidablePred</code> which is duplicative and inconsistent with the documentation. The only place <code>exists_least_of_bdd</code> is used has the porting note \"port of Int.exists_least_of_bdd requires DecidablePred, so we use classical\". Is there a reason <code>exists_least_of_bdd</code> cannot avoid <code>DecidablePred</code>?</p>",
