(I stopped running it somewhere in <code>Tactic</code>, so e.g. <code>Topology</code> is not covered yet.) Feel free to fix any number of them :-)</p>\n<p>This linter flags all lines which contain something <code>in backticks</code> which either</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exactly matches a mathlib3 file name (as evidenced by an <code>align_import</code>)</li>\n<li>exactly matches a mathlib3 declaration (as evidences by an <code>align</code>)<br>\nRelaxing this to also match just the file or lemma name or substrings is a natural follow-up, but perhaps let's fix the first wave of cases first :-)</li>\n</ul>",
