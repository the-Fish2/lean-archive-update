The idea is write something like <code>ring (mod 37)</code>, the tactic will search for a <code>CharP R 37</code> instance and use <code>norm_num</code> to reduce every constant mod 37. It seems totally achievable to do this in a <strong>copy</strong> of the ring tactic. But the file defining <code>CharP</code> and quite a few of its imports depend on <code>ring</code>. Since <a href=\"https://tqft.net/mathlib4files/Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Basic\">file#Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Basic</a> is quite a mess of results, I'm inclined to restructure it. But I thought I'd ask before getting in someone's way.</p>",
