(though some are <code>simp</code> lemmas). I found myself proving some statements by doing just: <code>apply simple_lemma_in_NullMeasurable; measurability</code>. It's technically not in the description of <code>measurability</code>, but is seems like it could be within its scope, if I understand how the latter works correctly. Was this tried and it didn't work out?</p>",
