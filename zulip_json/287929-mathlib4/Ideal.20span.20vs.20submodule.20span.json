This notation is shorter and more convenient, but it does sort of abuse the defeq <code>Ideal R = Submodule R R</code> (maybe I wouldn't worry as much about this if <code>Ideal</code> was an abbrev or if <code>Ideal.map</code> and <code>Submodule.map</code> weren't different) and causes some awkwardness with <code>rw</code>. Should existing instances of <code>Submodule.span R</code> in places where an <code>Ideal R</code> is expected be refactored to <code>Ideal.span</code> or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?</p>",
