Here are two examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When I write <code>maintainer merge</code>, I always receive a notification about the automatic message sent by <code>github-actions</code> to say I put the PR on the merge queue. See eg <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/8735#issuecomment-2033175810\">here</a>. I don't think we really need this message. Adding the <code>maintainer-merge</code> label would be enough to signify that the <code>maintainer merge</code> command was picked up, and wouldn't send me a useless notification.</li>\n<li>What often happens when you review a PR is that you get a notification when the PR author changes something, but CI isn't done yet so you are not sure whether you should be looking. It's not uncommon that a PR drops off my radar this way. This would be fixed if I was given a notification every time a PR is back on <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cKk3ld\">#queue</a>.</li>\n</ul>",
