I'd open a pull request to fix this, but do not know which of the following versions (or something else, or both) of the theorem should be used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Just remove the Nonempty-hypothesis. Probably make j₀ an explicit parameter then.</li>\n<li>Remove the parameter j₀. In this case the hypothesis h could be formulated by adding a universal quantifier over j₀.</li>\n</ol>",
