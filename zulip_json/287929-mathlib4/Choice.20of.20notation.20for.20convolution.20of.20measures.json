I think that it makes sense to use <code>*</code> for additive convolution, but I'm a bit worried about using the same thing for multiplicative convolution: if the underlying space is a additive AND a multiplicative monoid, <code>*</code> could then refer to either convolution, which I feel like might lead to undesirable confusion down the road...</p>",
