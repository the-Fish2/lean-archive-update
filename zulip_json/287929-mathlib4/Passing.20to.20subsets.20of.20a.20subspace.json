What do we think about this?</p>\n<p>This is motivated by <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/9940\">#9940</a>, which introduces scoped notation <code>s ↓∩ .</code> for the adjoint to <code>(Subtype.val : s -&gt; _) '' .</code>. Consistency means lemmas printed with this notation can look like <code>A ↓∩ B ⊆ A ↓∩ C ↔ A ∩ B ⊆ A ∩ C</code> rather than <code>A ↓∩ B ⊆ A ↓∩ C ↔ B ∩ A ⊆ C ∩ A</code>.</p>",
