Another consideration: if you have a file in the Foo/Bar folder which imports the others (i.e. you have all 'default.lean' equivalent files), then using only <code>Foo/Bar/*.lean</code> will build those other files as well, since <code>cache</code> will automatically take the dependency closure of the files you supply.</p>",
