It's super easy to write one, since it's simply non-negative random variables with expectation less than 1 wrt a particular measure, but we don't have it. That obviously also means that we don't have anything about them.</p>\n<p>I recently added a few things about the log-likelihood ratio (<a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=MeasureTheory.llr#doc\">docs#MeasureTheory.llr</a>), which for probability measures is an e-value (and abstracting away the particular definition of the LLR to consider more general random variables is one of the motivations of e-values Wouter Koolen mentioned last time we talked about it).  I did that as preparation for a project about information divergences and hypothesis testing.</p>",
