But because it really is just a rather simple definition on top of an arbitrary preorder, I have a suspicion this could have a more general name that I don't know/don't recognize.  I've so far tried looking into order-related things but didn't find anything (that was the likeliest place I thought of since it's a preorder, though actually making it an instance of a preorder would probably be a bad idea since it looks at a glance like it would likely conflict with the subset order on <code>Set α</code>).</p>",
