It would be nice if you knew anything about DR cohomology and divisors specifically not being in here...  I can be more specific if need-be- I wanted perhaps that DR cohomology matches singular cohomology with coefficients in ℝ for a smooth manifold, and also the definition of Weil and Cartier divisors or something similar, as well as the definition of a bundle or a fiber bundle.</p>",
