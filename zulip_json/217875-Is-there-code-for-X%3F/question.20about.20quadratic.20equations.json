The next step in my proof is to continue with a new hypothesis that the discriminant &gt;= 0 if solutions exist. I looked through the docs, but I'm not able to use any of the discriminant theorems there. How do I continue?</p>",

I would multiply both sides of the equation by 4*(6-4k), rewrite as <code>(2*(6-4k)*x+(2-9*k^2))^2=mess</code> using <code>ring</code>/<code>polyrith</code> and deduce the result you need from squre&gt;=0, i.e. I'd just complete the square manually because for me that would be quicker than looking in the library.</p>",
