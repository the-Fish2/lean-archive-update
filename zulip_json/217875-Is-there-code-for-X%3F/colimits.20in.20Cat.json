Has anyone shown the same for colimits in Cat?</p>\n<p>If not, I imagine it would be useful to demonstrate that they are constructed by means of the reflective subcategory inclusion into reflexive directed graphs (which is a presheaf category and thus cocomplete). The Monads directly has a few theorems such as  <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=CategoryTheory.hasColimits_of_reflective#doc\">docs#CategoryTheory.hasColimits_of_reflective</a> which show that such subcategories have colimits though doesn't give a definition of them as far as I can tell.</p>",
