Thus the lowest hanging fruit here would be to define a Dynkin Diagram, classify the simple ones, prove that one can uniquely obtain the associated root system (and that direct sum of dynkin diagrams =&gt; direct sum of roots) and thus classify the root systems (for those not familiar with this, this is a result in euclidean geometry that doesn't use anything more complicated than Cauchy Schwartz).</p>",
