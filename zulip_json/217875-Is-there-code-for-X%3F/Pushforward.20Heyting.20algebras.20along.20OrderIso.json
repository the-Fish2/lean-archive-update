We already have <code>Closed α ≃o (Opens α)ᵒᵈ</code>, so all I need is a way to either push <code>HeytingAlgebra (Opens α)</code> to <code>HeytingAlgebra (Closed α)ᵒᵈ</code> or <code>CoheytingAlgebra (Opens α)ᵒᵈ</code> to <code>CoheytingAlgebra (Closed α)</code>, but I can't seem to be able to figure out how to do that exactly. I found <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=HeytAlg.Iso.mk#doc\">docs#HeytAlg.Iso.mk</a>, but I'm afraid the category theory vocabulary is flying over my head</p>",
