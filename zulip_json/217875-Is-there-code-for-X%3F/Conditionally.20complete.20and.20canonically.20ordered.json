Is there a way to assume that <code>α</code> is both conditionally complete and is canonically ordered? My understanding is no, and that the reason these types aren't mixins is because we want to use custom values of min/max/sup/inf. Is there a way to assume both of these things in mathlib as-is?</p>",
