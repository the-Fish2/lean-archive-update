In proving for example the maximal entropy there is quite a bit of manipulation to be done with sums and measures. For now it seems to be working but I am wondering more for the rest of the theorems. A choice I made so far is in the definition of entropy to convert the measure of terms in partitions to real numbers. Next theorems are the one in proposition 1.7 like the relation between the entropy and information function</p>",
