Off the top of my head lean-cli is for arg parsing, there are some http/network stuff but nothing super mature. Also some people have worked on DB libraries. Json serialization is provided as a <code>deriving ToJson</code> handler by lean itself. There is some experimental optics/lenses code as a PR to mathlib4 that was closed recently. But should be findable.</p>",
