I find it really hard to keep myself going on this without a goal, so I was thinking of taking the book by Nielsen and Chuang and (very) slowly formalize each chapter as a goalpost.</p>\n<p>I did a bit of search and I found that formalization of quantum information/quantum computing is somewhat limited. That said, this is probably me missing important works from very brief searches. That said, I know formalization is highly non-trivial task and I would like to better understand if (1) this is already an ongoing active project by a sub-community, and/or (2) whether this is an interesting sub-field to formalize. Given life's limitations I want to be more informed about whether it makes sense for me to be part of this effort before committing. </p>\n<p>I would very much appreciate any input/concern/question/recommendations/contacts. Thanks!</p>",
