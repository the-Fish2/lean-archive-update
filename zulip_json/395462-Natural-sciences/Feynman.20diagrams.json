There are a set of rules called `Feynman rules', which allow you to go from a Feynman diagram to its corresponding algebraic expression. The Feynman rules depend on the specific physical theory under study (e.g. the Standard Model of particle physics).</p>\n<p>There are a number of mathematical ways to represent Feynman diagrams, e.g.: <br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0106001\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0106001</a> or (defn. 12) in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0212121\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0212121</a>. </p>\n<p>Sorry this is all a bit vague, but if this sounds interesting to anyone (so much so that they want to get involved) please let me know.</p>",

If you could have a formal proof of that rather than a numerical calculation which might not be trusted then that would actually be a useful result. Or you could prove upper and lower bounds on physical quantities.</p>",
