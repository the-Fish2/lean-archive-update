This does not have much effect on mathlib outside of the <code>Matroid</code> development, which seems to use it heavily.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"329425\">@Peter Nelson</span>, as I think you're the primary author of the Matroid material, could I ask you to take a look at this and see if you can come up with a redesign that relies on <code>auto_param</code> in rewrite lemmas less?</p>\n<p>For now I've just inserted <code>by aesop_mat</code> as an argument to all the rewrite lemmas that are failing. Please have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/lean-pr-testing-2793\">branch#lean-pr-testing-2793</a> to see how it looks.</p>",
