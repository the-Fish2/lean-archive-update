Both are useful because they have incomparable runtime behaviors for different values of the scale. <code>DiscreteLaplaceSampleLoop</code> is more efficient for small scales, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>Currently, we use only <code>DiscreteLaplaceSampleLoop</code> but eventually, we will use both  and we will need to make sure that both are tested and proved.
