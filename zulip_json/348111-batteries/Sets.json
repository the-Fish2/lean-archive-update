The thing we are proof-of-concepting is a JSON Schema implementation, and morally the return type of validation is something like a slightly enriched <code>Set ValidationError</code>. Order is not relevant, and in any other language I'd use the obvious set type for the language. But of course the point of Lean is being able to prove things about this set, and if no tactics are going to work with what we choose then we are in bad shape</p>",

Further edit: dicts are insertion order as a feature, not just implementation detail, and so, carry it as a guarantee. Sets are not guaranteed to be insertion order iterable.</p>",

Not all operations will actually satisfy the quotient properties, and it is bad to make those other operations not expressible. (See the horrible hack used to make <code>Repr ℝ</code> work in mathlib.) The main ones will, but for example Rust's <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> has a <code>capacity()</code> method which returns different values on \"equal\" vectors. Iterating a HashMap will be incredibly painful for the user code if the HashMap is a quotient type.</p>",
