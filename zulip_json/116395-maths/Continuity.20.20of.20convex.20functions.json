I noticed that there was a discussion about the continuity of convex functions in this <a href=\"#narrow/stream/116395-maths/topic/Convex.20functions.20are.20continuous\">chat</a>. I wonder what have been done about this. Specificlly, can we prove that in finite dimesional space, the convex function is locally Lipschitz continuous at the interior point. If we have this theorem, we can directly get that in finite dimensional space, if a function is convex over the entire space, then it is continuous or locally Lipschitz. We can find the theorem in the book first-order-methods-in-optimization as <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/yX1DvUwO9x069JmtpceYRH7h/pic.png\">pic.png</a><br>\nThank you very much for joining in this discussion.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/yX1DvUwO9x069JmtpceYRH7h/pic.png\" title=\"pic.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/yX1DvUwO9x069JmtpceYRH7h/pic.png\"></a></div>",
