The original Catalan proof doesn't need anything like strong effective Baker bounds, and whilst the Mazur-Wiles IMC proof is probably a tall order, the proof using cyclotomic units is surely feasible. Both projects probably need a leader though, and a leader probably has to be someone who's doing some kind of approximation to \"working full time on the project\".</p>",
