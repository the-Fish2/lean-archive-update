I gave a talk last year at Cambridge and Wenda showed me this (and lots of other interesting things!). I've been meaning to find the time/collaborator/student to work on this as I really want it for the finite dimensionality of spaces of modular forms. I haven't watched the talk yet, but I'm guessing this is what the question was about. I'm also interested to know where we are with meromorphic functions (but perhaps on another stream).</p>",
