However, occasionally the <code>aesop</code> invocation fails. I expected <code>try rw [h (by aesop)]</code> to be a no-op if the <code>by aesop</code> fails. However, it breaks the proof. Does anyone know how to use an inline <code>(by _)</code> expression to resolve hypotheses in a way which is compatible with <code>try</code>, or some other way to produce the same desired behavior?</p>",
