When I try to use the same match set up in the proof, the wildcard case doesn't seem to have any hypothesis recognizing that it's not in one of the overlapping cases, so I can't prove it that way, and I haven't been able to make other tactics (e.g. cases) work either, though perhaps there's a subtlety I haven't caught.</p>\n<p>(In this case handling the cases manually with by_cases or the like wouldn't be so bad, but the actual example involves more cases and I need to prove several lemmas that all parallel the match structure of the definition, so it would be nice to have a structured way to do this.)</p>",

I have a git snapshot of the situation; but it's two MIT licensed lean repo's smashed together; hadn't personally encountered that type of licensing situation and thus haven't yet pushed to GH.)</p>",
