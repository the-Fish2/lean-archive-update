I was trying to solve level 8 of the Multiplication world. I have atttached a picture of my code above for reference. After line 5, I wanted to use a targeted rewrite appealing to the associaitviy of addition but I would get an error  whenever I tried to use \"rw [add_assoc a<em>c d</em>c c]. I figured the reason why this doesn't work is because lean expects the lefthand side to be exactly of the form x + y + z where x,y,and z are natural numbers. However, if I use the untargeted version of rewrite, it seems to work exactly the way I wanted it to. Why does Lean behave like this?</p>",
