I've followed the instructions (<a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean</a>) to set up vscode and the book's repository, but unfortunately I keep getting \"unkown package\" errors for Mathlib as well as MIL packages. I also get a warning that the opened folder if  not a valid Lean 4 project because it does not contain a lean-toolchain file, but the MIL repository obviously does contain a lean-toolchain file. Any ideas what might be causing this and how to resolve the issue? Thanks!<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QLw3LeRk73kxQeF5zQT0dPA6/Screenshot-from-2024-03-08-14-50-15.png\">Screenshot-from-2024-03-08-14-50-15.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QLw3LeRk73kxQeF5zQT0dPA6/Screenshot-from-2024-03-08-14-50-15.png\" title=\"Screenshot-from-2024-03-08-14-50-15.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/QLw3LeRk73kxQeF5zQT0dPA6/Screenshot-from-2024-03-08-14-50-15.png\"></a></div>",
