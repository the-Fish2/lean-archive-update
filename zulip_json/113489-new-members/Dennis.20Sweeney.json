My work so far is <a href=\"https://github.com/sweeneyde/1mfld\">here</a>, but in particular there are <a href=\"https://github.com/sweeneyde/1mfld/blob/dde15dc9de9788ab2b5898880504c95ff0983efb/one_mfld/RealIntervals.lean#L431-L473\">some facts about connected sets of reals</a> that might be useful to have in mathlib.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/contribute/index.html\">how to</a> mentioned that I should request write access to add a branch on the main mathlib repo, so I'd like to do that: my github username is <code>sweeneyde</code>.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
