I followed the steps from this link <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean3/install/windows.html\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean3/install/windows.html</a> , but could not get it work in my VS code. The VS output window says \"Watchdog error: Cannot read LSP request: A Lean 3 request was received. Please ensure that your editor has a Lean 4 compatible extension installed.\" I understand lean3 is obsolete but still need it. Could someone help me with getting lean3 running?
