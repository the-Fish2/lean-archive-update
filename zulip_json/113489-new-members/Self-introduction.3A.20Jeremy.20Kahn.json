Aside from finding Lean to be a highly addictive (and frequently sleep-destroying) video game for mathematicians, I'm hoping to contribute to the development of Lean as a tool for verifying research mathematics (including my own). </p>\n<p>In particular I'm interested in automating formalization, and even more specifically, in the automated completion of subgoals.</p>",
