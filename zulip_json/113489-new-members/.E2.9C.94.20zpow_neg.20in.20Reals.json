The theorem zpow_neg / pow_add exists elsewhere in the DivisionRing or Naturals etc, but since the exponent is real, I'm unsure how to proceed. I know that this is simple arithmetic, but I've been stuck for a while on this piece of a larger proof. Thank you!</p>\n<p>Real.rpow_add. Today I learned that r means real... :(</p>",
