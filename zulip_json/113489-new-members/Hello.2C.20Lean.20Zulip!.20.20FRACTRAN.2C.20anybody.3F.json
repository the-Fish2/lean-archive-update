Conway with some remarkable properties. <a href=\"https://github.com/sanchace/FRACTRAN\">Here is the link to the GitHub repo; there are more details (linked to) in the README.</a> It's still very early in the project, and I'm no expert yet. However, my professor suggested that I make a post here in case anybody is interested in my project. Maybe one day we will have something worthy of a mathlib contribution, who knows? I am pleased to introduce myself to you all, and thank you for your attention!</p>",
