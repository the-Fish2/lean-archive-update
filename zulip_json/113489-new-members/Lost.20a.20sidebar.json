I made the beginner's mistake of accidentally closing the side bar that shows the current goal. Upon restarting the entire editor I found out it's called 'lean infoview'. How can I get it back without restarting the editor?<br>\nThanks in advance! Greetings from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"631462\">@Jana Göken</span></p>",
