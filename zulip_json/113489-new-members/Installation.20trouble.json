I went ahead and tried to \"install\" the Mathematics in Lean book.  When I type either <code>source ~/.profile</code> or <code>source ~/.bash_profile</code> I get the following message: no such file or directory: /Users/jaclynlang/.profile.  I did install Mathematics in Lean and I have a folder called mathematics_in_lean.  But when I run the command <code>lake exe cache get</code>, I get the message:  zsh: command not found: lake.  Can someone help me figure out what is going on?  Thank you!</p>",
