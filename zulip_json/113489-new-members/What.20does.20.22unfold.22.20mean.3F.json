I tried the Lean 4 manual and the API docs, too.</p>\n<p>I gather that it means something like evaluate, reduce, expand, substitute definitions of--something like that.  But it seems to be an important concept for Lean, so I'd like to understand it more clearly.  (I've been programming for many years, and recently I learned Idris and a little bit of Agda, but I don't recall seeing this term before starting to learn Lean.  It's probably not used only for Lean, but a full web search is going to be difficult.)</p>",
