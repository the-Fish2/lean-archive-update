The definition of a full functor in mathlib requires me to first provide a <code>preimage</code>, and then to provide a proof that the preimage is indeed the preimage (<code>witness</code>). Now in the process of constructing the preimage, I use <code>Classical.choose h</code>, where <code>h</code> is some quite specific hypothesis I show during the proof. Now, when proving <code>witness</code> I want to use <code>Classical.choose_spec h</code>, but this requires me to reprove <code>h</code>. Is there some way I can avoid this and use <code>h</code> again without having to reprove it? My <code>h</code> is quite specific, so I don't think its worth adding as an auxillary lemma (unless this is the only way of avoiding reproving it).</p>",
