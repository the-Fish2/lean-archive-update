And writing out the definition of that goal (with <code>rewrite [fam_union_def]</code>) leads to the goal <code>∃ S ∈ {B | ∃ S ∈ F, B = A ∩ S}, x ∈ S</code>.  I think you must have done one further step, which was to use <code>w</code> as the \"witness\" for <code>S</code> in the goal.  Choosing a witness for an existential goal is always a somewhat risky step--you are free to use whatever you want as the witness, but if you make the wrong choice you can get stuck.  That's what's happened in this case.  You need to back up and choose your witness more carefully.</p>",
