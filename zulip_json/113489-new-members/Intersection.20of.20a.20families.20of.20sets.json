If that's your goal, then since it starts with <code>∀ S</code>, a good first step would be to introduce an arbitrary <code>S</code> by using the tactic <code>intro S</code>.  But it looks like you may have done that, because in your next message you have <code>S : Set U</code> in the context and now your goal is listed as <code>S ∈ {A, B} → x ∈ S</code>.  But once again, the form of the goal suggests what your next step should be.  Since your goal is an if-then statement, a good next step would be to introduce the assumption <code>S ∈ {A, B}</code>, once again using the <code>intro</code> tactic.</p>\n<p>The hints in the set theory game also tell you about a theorem you can use to write out the meaning of <code>S ∈ {A, B}</code>.</p>",
