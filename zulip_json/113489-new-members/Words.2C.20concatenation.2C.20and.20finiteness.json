So, the free monoid on some type. I saw in the documentation that </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean4\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">List</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"bp\">\\</span><span class=\"n\">alpha</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>with concatenation is the free monoid over <code>\\alpha</code>, and this looks like a good place to start.</p>\n<p>One lemma that I was expecting to find there is that, for any word w, the set of factorizations of w as a product of two words is a finite set - but I did not find it, very possibly because I don't know where to look. But, it might be a good exercise for me.</p>\n<p>But, more generally, I am a bit lost with the various notions of finiteness, between <code>Finset</code>, <code>Fin</code>, <code>Fintype</code>, <code>Finite</code>... I mean, I see roughly what the different notions are, but I am not sure which is the better choice.</p>\n<p>(Also, it looks like I don't know how to type so that \\alpha becomes a nice Greek letter)</p>",
