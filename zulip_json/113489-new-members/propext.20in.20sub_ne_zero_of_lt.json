So I traced it back to <code>sub_ne_zero_of_lt</code>, which  uses <code>simp</code>. Here <code>simp</code> is eagerly using <code>propext</code> for no reason. Would it be fine to switch it to a more explicit proof? (The whole extent of the change is <code>by simp</code> -&gt; <code>by intro; contradiction</code>). I can put up a PR if this is OK <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
