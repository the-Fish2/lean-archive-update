Also it's possible that the code you are working on is related to the issue, so getting a <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mwe.html\">#mwe</a> example is helpful for replication.</p>\n<p>Note that Lean moves fast and \"I updated Lean 4 a month ago\" means you are on an old version, so I recommend updating lean and see if the problem persists. But I don't think there is any recent issue that sounds like this one, so there's a good chance the current version also has the same problem, whatever it is.</p>",
