For example, I want to prove <code>FirstOrder.Language.Equiv.symm_symm</code>, but then <code>Equiv.symm_symm</code> (the one about equivalences between types) is hidden if you open <code>FirstOrder.Language</code>. What would be the correct way of handling this situation?<br>\nI have the impression that the problem here is that the path for <code>Equiv.symm_symm</code> is really just that, and so I cannot give more information to Lean so that it understands that this is really the one I want.</p>",
