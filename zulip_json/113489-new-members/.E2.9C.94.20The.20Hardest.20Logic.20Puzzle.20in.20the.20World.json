Following is the explanation for the case with 2 blue-eyed people in the island:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that \"<strong>if</strong> I don't have blue eyes <strong>[HYPOTHESIS 1]</strong>, <strong>then</strong> that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And <strong>if</strong> he's the only person, by <strong>THEOREM 1</strong> he will leave tonight.\" They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes \"My <strong>HYPOTHESIS 1</strong> was incorrect. I must have blue eyes.\" And each leaves the second night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before <em>they wait and see</em> we need to proof that they can't deduce their color on the first day, which is intuitive but not trivial given <em>they are all perfect logicians</em>. </p>\n<p>It is easy to get that assumption for granted, but I'm not sure how to formalize it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I started with a formalization in which I can prove facts they know, but not facts they don't know. <br>\nHere is my code: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mfornet/bef36eafc40ed7be9bb13e61cfb30997\">https://gist.github.com/mfornet/bef36eafc40ed7be9bb13e61cfb30997</a></p>",
