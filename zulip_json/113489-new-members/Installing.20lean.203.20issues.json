For a first impression, you can probably hide a lot of lean's complexity. I've wondered what it would look like to craft a gentle introduction to formalization in this way. Even if it just makes for improved error messages based on the fact that the author understands exactly what the student is attempting to accomplish. If really polished, I could imagine teaching high-school students some of this stuff in an interactive, iterative feedback environment. Sounds cool.</p>\n<p>It seems like there would be at least 2 big downsides:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's also not clear how hard it would be to maintain such a project as Lean isn't that stable yet. It would probably be a lot of work for an uncertain amount of benefit. It's often trial by fire that shows what helps and what doesn't.</li>\n<li>As students move beyond the DSL, they'd face some confusion about what changes and what stays the same. For example, the Natural Numbers Game changes a few tactics a bit and has a different definition for the <code>≤</code> operator. I think they are good choices, but once in a while you'll see a question here that gets asked as a direct result of not realizing this.</li>\n</ol>",

If the port is not ready, I'll get to work on it myself, and see if it's worth it. To address the other feedback (and, I thank you all for that), I really had plans to work on other things, but I'll get back to you.</p>",
