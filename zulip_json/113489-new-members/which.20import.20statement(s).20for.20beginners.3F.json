I agree with this approach if it helps beginners like me get past the initial barriers.</p>\n<p>However, I'd like to start creating simple vanilla Lean 4 proofs - really simple ones. To do this I need to import a minimum set of libraries to enable me to use tactics such as <code>ring</code>, <code>rw [hypothesis]</code>, <code>gcongr</code>,<code>linarith</code> and <code>positivity</code>.</p>\n<p>What are the libraries I need to import? Are there several or just one? Should I import specific subsets of the library or import the whole massive mathlib? What is considered good practice?</p>",
