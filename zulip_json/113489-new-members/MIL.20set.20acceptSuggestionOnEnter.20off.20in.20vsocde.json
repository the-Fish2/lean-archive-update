Is there any reason that MIL set <code>\"editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter\"</code> to the value <code>\"off\"</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean/blob/master/.vscode/settings.json#L26\">.vscode/settings.json#L26</a>? It seems making vscode failed complete suggestions with enter. And I cannot complete suggestions with other keys hence I turn it back on. But I don't know if it's some reason for this setting default to off in the repo</p>",
