In this proof we see:<code>refine' isClosed_ball.mem_of_tendsto ylim _</code>where isClosedBall is a proof the closed balls are indeed closed sets but that is satisfying one of the hypothesis of the theorem IsClosed.mem_of_tendsto. How did this hypothesis make into the name of the theorem as if we were working with a new theorem?</p>",
