It is this kernel that gives Lean its special character<strong>, and its name</strong>. Dependent type theory serves as a foundational language, allowing us to describe all sorts of objects and prove things about them. The foundational language fixes the meaning of the objects we introduce, and the kernel ensures that the things we prove about them are correct.\"</p>\n<p>with changes highlighted in bold.</p>",
