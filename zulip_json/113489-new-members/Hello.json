        "content": "<p>OK so welcome to type theory. </p>\n<p>The definition of <code>CompactSpace X</code> is <code>IsCompact (Set.univ : Set X)</code>. So what is going on here is that Lean maintains a distinction between \"sets and subsets\", or, what in Lean would be called types and subsets (or just types and sets). As you've seen in the statement of your theorem above, you have a type <code>X</code> and then you have <code>S : Set X</code>. So what is going on here is that <code>Set X</code> is a type (the type of subsets of <code>X</code>, or the type of sets whose elements are in <code>X</code> if you like), and <code>S : Set X</code> means that <code>S</code> is a term of that type. In particular <em><code>S</code> is a term</em>, so in particular <em><code>S</code> is not a type</em>. However it is possible to <em>make</em> a type from <code>S</code>. This type is called <code>↑S</code>, and a term of this type is a <em>pair</em> consisting of a term <code>x : X</code> and a proof of <code>x ∈ S</code>. This distinction is kept even when talking about \"the subset <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span> of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span>\" -- you cannot refer to this subset as <code>X</code> because <code>X</code> is a type and subsets are terms, so it needs another name and that name is <code>Set.univ : Set X</code>. </p>\n<p>This twist adds an extra layer of complexity to arguments in topology. If you look at the definition of <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/find/?pattern=IsCompact#doc\">docs#IsCompact</a> then you'll see that it is a predicate on <em>subsets</em> of a topological space. Initially a lot of mathlib was built up in this way, talking about subsets and then if you want to talk about the full type then just apply the predicate to the \"universal subset\". One place where things really get thorny is taking subsets of a subset, because then you take a subset, promote it from a term to a type by adding an arrow, and then take another subset, and unfortunately the subset of the promoted type is not <em>equal</em> to a subset of the original type (by <em>equal</em> I mean \"equal in type theory\" -- of course the concepts of a subset and a subset of a subset are <em>mathematically</em> equal but unfortunately we are not doing mathematics here, we are wrestling with foundational nonsense).</p>\n<p>The lemma you cite talks about <code>IsCompact</code>, so it's talking about compactness as a property of subsets not of types, and your hypothesis uses <code>CompactSpace</code>, so there is some glue needed to make things work. Either you find the right lemma (where the big space is a <code>CompactSpace</code>) or you muddle through with the lemma you've suggested, which would look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">Mathlib</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">SpectralSpace</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">TopologicalSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"kd\">extends</span> <span class=\"n\">CompactSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">QuasiSober</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">QuasiSeparatedSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">T0Space</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Prop</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">qc_open_basis</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">U</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">},</span> <span class=\"bp\">∀</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">U</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">IsOpen</span> <span class=\"n\">U</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span>\n    <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">IsOpen</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">IsCompact</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">∈</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"bp\">∧</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"bp\">⊆</span> <span class=\"n\">U</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">variable</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">X</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span><span class=\"bp\">*</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">TopologicalSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span>\n\n<span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">closed_of_spectral_is_spectral</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">SpectralSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hS</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">IsClosed</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">SpectralSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">isCompact_univ</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span>\n      <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">h1</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">IsCompact</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Set.univ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">exact</span><span class=\"bp\">?</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- translate from CompactSpace to IsCompact</span>\n      <span class=\"k\">have</span> <span class=\"n\">h2</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">IsCompact.of_isClosed_subset</span> <span class=\"n\">h1</span> <span class=\"n\">hS</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"n\">exact</span><span class=\"bp\">?</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- now you can apply your lemma</span>\n      <span class=\"n\">exact</span><span class=\"bp\">?</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- now translate back to CompactSpace</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">sober</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">inter_isCompact</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">t0</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">qc_open_basis</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>",

(Right? Or is it a proof that the predicate 'sober' is true?). So, I would like to apply this to my hypothesis IsIrreducible U. The syntax for this seems to be<br>\n<code>apply h1.sober at hU1</code> but then I of course get the error message</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">Failed</span> <span class=\"n\">to</span> <span class=\"n\">find</span> <span class=\"n\">IsIrreducible</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">U</span> <span class=\"n\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">the</span> <span class=\"n\">type</span> <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">a</span> <span class=\"kd\">parameter</span> <span class=\"n\">of</span> <span class=\"n\">IsIrreducible</span> <span class=\"bp\">?</span><span class=\"n\">m.657</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">IsClosed</span> <span class=\"bp\">?</span><span class=\"n\">m.657</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"bp\">∃</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">IsGenericPoint</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"bp\">?</span><span class=\"n\">m.657.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The reason, from what I understand, is that U is not a term of type Set X but rather a term of Set ↑S! So of course we cannot apply h1.sober directly because it takes in terms of type Set X. I guess U is a pair consisting of a term U : Set X and a proof that U \\subset S. Is there a way to get at the \"underlying\" term U : Set X?</p>\n<p>Another reason why I am asking is because I am trying to prove that, if S is a closed subset of a topological space X and T is a closed subset of S, then T is closed in X. I couldn't find a theorem to that effect, which is surprising. It's possible I didn't look well enough. In any case, I tried the following:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">theorem</span> <span class=\"n\">closed_of_closed_implies_closed</span> <span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"n\">TopologicalSpace</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">]</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">S</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"n\">X</span><span class=\"o\">}</span> <span class=\"o\">{</span><span class=\"n\">T</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">Set</span> <span class=\"bp\">↑</span><span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hS</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">IsClosed</span> <span class=\"n\">S</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">hT</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">IsClosed</span> <span class=\"n\">T</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">IsClosed</span> <span class=\"n\">T</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"gr\">sorry</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>but of course this is silly because the first IsClosed T means as a subset of S and the second IsClosed T is supposed to mean as a subset of X, but it doesn't. Somehow, it seems I should be able to refer to the underlying T : Set X so that the second IsClosed T refers to that. Unless there are other ways to deal with these finicky subset of subset things.</p>",
