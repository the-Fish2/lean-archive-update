You would have to re-elaborate the relevant file from scratch (and doing this in the same process as an existing lean elaboration is somewhat hazardous due to the use of global variables in the elaborator), and watch for when the theorem of interest is added to the environment to deduce which command is relevant and has the info trees you want. Doable, but very expensive, and untested (there may be additional unforeseen issues that arise when attempting this).</p>",
