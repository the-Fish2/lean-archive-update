I had a little exposure to F* for proof-oriented programming as a tool in verified computing and verified cryptographic hardware/software and some libs seem to exist towards those goals. How  Does Lean compare to F*? Can I do in Lean cryptography \"straightforwardly\" (i.e. libraries exist) or the project is more oriented towards formalized mathematics? Thanks.</p>",
