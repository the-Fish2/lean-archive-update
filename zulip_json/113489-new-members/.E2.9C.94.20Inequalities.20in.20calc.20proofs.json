I'm having a hard time putting what how I conceived of it to words - it was wrong, which doesn't help - but I had always tried think of the _ as the left hand side of what I was working on.  That seemed to work for equalities, but I struggled with inequalities.  Now I see why.  Thank you very much.</p>",
