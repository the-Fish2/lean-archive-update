In Lean/mathlib, each category <code>C</code> has two attached universes: the universe <code>u</code> such that <code>C : Type u</code> and the universe <code>v</code> such that <code>(X ⟶ Y) : Type v</code> for all <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>. Then, a priori, the type of natural transformations is in <code>Type (max u v)</code>, but the bijection in Yoneda's lemma shows it is in bijection with a type in <code>Type v</code>.</p>\n<p>In the case of a \"large category\", <code>u = v + 1</code>, so that this indeed lowers the universe level by one.</p>",
