I did go through the Natural Numbers Game, which was fun a challenging, though the meaning and scope of many tactics was still not clear.  Right now, in trying to do the exercises from Theorem proving in Lean it seems necessary to find the axioms and theorems pertaining to a particular structure (such as Group).  Is there some organized way of doing this, besides trying to guess what they might be called?</p>",
