What do these mean? Does the attribute <code>@[extern]</code> link this definition to some concrete definitions and functions of float? (Maybe some float in C or some language other than Lean?) Thank you!</p>",

The <code>extern</code> annotation can be put on any function and tells the compiler part of Lean to replace references of this function with ones to the C function mentioned in the <code>extern</code></p>",
