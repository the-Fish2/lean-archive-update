I set proving Desargues's Theorem as the end goal, but I couldn't reach to it. I learnt the basics of Lean, stated some basic definitions and proved some basic properties of the theory. I followed the book \"Modern Projective Geometry\". The source code of the repository is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/oneofvalts/desargues\">https://github.com/oneofvalts/desargues</a></p>\n<p>Is this something that is useful to be in mathlib? Also, how can I improve the code?</p>",
