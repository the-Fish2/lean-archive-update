OTOH, I've read about the attempt to build a system that wins the Olympiad, where old number theory would have possibly more use? But these systems would likely be closed/proprietary, and the only way to contribute there would be to put lean files on GitHub and hope they will be scraped by someone. So, my question:</p>\n<p>Regarding proofs for things like <code>\"$a^{2m+1}+1$ can be divided by $a+1$\" [Euler, E026]</code> or \"if any numbers of the form $a^n+1$ are prime, it is necessary, that they be of the form $a^{2^m}+1$\" [Euler, E026]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>are these of ANY use?</li>\n<li>is someone collecting classical NT lean files?</li>\n<li>is there a repo dedicated to the Olympiad effort?</li>\n<li>is there a repo taking contributions that don't go in Mathlib?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would continue to improve my formalization skills but the answers to the above would change the path I'll take.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>",

We don't only want things that are modern if older things are still relevant to mathematics that people do today. Certainly some of the work of Euler would be a welcome addition in many cases. The main thing to look for is that the results should be sufficiently general.</p>",
