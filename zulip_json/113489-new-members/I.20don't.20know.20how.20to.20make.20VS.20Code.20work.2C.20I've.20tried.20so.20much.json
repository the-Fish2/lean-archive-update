I also followed the setup guide on VS Code as much as I could and thought it was maybe because of where I was storing everything or where I was creating the project but I wasn't able to make anything work. I have uninstalled everything and reinstalled it again and it still didn't work. I also tried to change the path variables on my computer to see if it would work.</p>\n<p>The following screenshots are the messages/output that are shown most often, and where stuff is within my files:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QifU8gvSCqJjg_l6zU0DPimh/screenshotlean2.png\">screenshotlean2.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/EPfstt9Vp88YBRMHD1bSfWeJ/screenshotlean3.png\">screenshotlean3.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/FkuQMyK2oh02zBSCksUb812f/screenshotlean4.png\">screenshotlean4.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/SWw1ZFv-2ca1sJbchSMZbDem/screenshotlean5.png\">screenshotlean5.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/UNIbn9AGBpxz-Sq9MTrapk1a/screenshotlean1.png\">screenshotlean1.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/QifU8gvSCqJjg_l6zU0DPimh/screenshotlean2.png\" title=\"screenshotlean2.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/QifU8gvSCqJjg_l6zU0DPimh/screenshotlean2.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/EPfstt9Vp88YBRMHD1bSfWeJ/screenshotlean3.png\" title=\"screenshotlean3.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/EPfstt9Vp88YBRMHD1bSfWeJ/screenshotlean3.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/FkuQMyK2oh02zBSCksUb812f/screenshotlean4.png\" title=\"screenshotlean4.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/FkuQMyK2oh02zBSCksUb812f/screenshotlean4.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/SWw1ZFv-2ca1sJbchSMZbDem/screenshotlean5.png\" title=\"screenshotlean5.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/SWw1ZFv-2ca1sJbchSMZbDem/screenshotlean5.png\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/UNIbn9AGBpxz-Sq9MTrapk1a/screenshotlean1.png\" title=\"screenshotlean1.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/UNIbn9AGBpxz-Sq9MTrapk1a/screenshotlean1.png\"></a></div><p>Thank you in advance for the help!!</p>",
