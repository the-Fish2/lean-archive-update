I don't know what it's called or where it is so I hover over the '^' and ctrl+click and select \"Go to Definitions\". This takes me to a file with the line <code>macro_rules | </code>($x ^ $y)   =&gt; <code>(binop% HPow.hPow $x $y)</code>. This line doesn't allow me to navigate to definitions/declarations/etc, but another reference to HPow.hPow in the same file does, and it takes me to this definition: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">class</span> <span class=\"n\">HPow</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">u</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">β</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">v</span><span class=\"o\">)</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">γ</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">outParam</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"kt\">Type</span> <span class=\"n\">w</span><span class=\"o\">))</span> <span class=\"n\">where</span>\n  <span class=\"sd\">/-- `a ^ b` computes `a` to the power of `b`.</span>\n<span class=\"sd\">  The meaning of this notation is type-dependent. -/</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">hPow</span> <span class=\"o\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">α</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">β</span> <span class=\"bp\">→</span> <span class=\"n\">γ</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I also find some definitions of related functions like Pow, but I cannot find what I'm looking for. Presumably somewhere in the chain of imports an instance of HPow was defined for reals and it contains the definition of hPow that I want. I try some things like <code>#check Real.HPow</code> or <code>#check HPow \\R \\R</code> to see if I can construct a term of that type and then find its definition, but I am not able to. I also do some online searches of HPow in mathlib4 github/documentation, and I see quite a few results but after a bit of scanning I still cannot find what I'm looking for. </p>\n<p>So I have two questions. (1) Could someone please direct me to the definition I'm looking for, and, more importantly, (2) What was the correct way for me search for the definition? Thanks!</p>",
