Is the coherence theorem for monoidal categories possible proved using the strictness theorem, i.e. that every monoidal category is monoidally equivalent to a strict monoidal category, as said in <a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf\">/tensor categories, theorem 2.9.2/</a>?

Traditionally it seems easier to understand the proof using \"the strictness theorem\" approach rather than \"the free category\" approach for the coherence theorem.
