This approach is primarily to facilitate students' access, ensuring they do not need to run commands to convert files into PDFs themselves.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as a secondary focus, each book's PDF should have an official URL for the current version, to minimize the risk of link rot and ensure long-term availability.</p>\n<p>The initial list was sourced from the \"Learning Lean 4\" page, emphasizing books with available official PDF versions. I have expanded this list with other relevant books found during my research.</p>\n<p>Below is the current list of Lean 4 books in English, each with an easily accessible, official PDF of the current version:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>[Added!]</em> Formalising Mathematics (Kevin Buzzard): <a href=\"https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024/formalisingmathematics.pdf\">https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/formalising-mathematics-2024/formalisingmathematics.pdf</a></li>\n<li>How To Prove It With Lean (Daniel J. Velleman): <a href=\"https://djvelleman.github.io/HTPIwL/How-To-Prove-It-With-Lean.pdf\">https://djvelleman.github.io/HTPIwL/How-To-Prove-It-With-Lean.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Logic and Mechanized Reasoning (Jeremy Avigad, Marijn J. H. Heule, Wojciech Nawrocki): <a href=\"https://avigad.github.io/lamr/logic_and_mechanized_reasoning.pdf\">https://avigad.github.io/lamr/logic_and_mechanized_reasoning.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Mathematics in Lean (Jeremy Avigad, Patrick Massot): <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/mathematics_in_lean.pdf\">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/mathematics_in_lean.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Metaprogramming in Lean 4 (Arthur Paulino, Damiano Testa, Edward Ayers, Evgenia Karunus, Henrik Böving, Jannis Limperg, Siddhartha Gadgil, Siddharth Bhat): <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-metaprogramming-book/releases/download/latest/Metaprogramming.in.Lean.4.pdf\">https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean4-metaprogramming-book/releases/download/latest/Metaprogramming.in.Lean.4.pdf</a></li>\n<li>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Logical Verification (Anne Baanen, Alexander Bentkamp, Jasmin Blanchette, Johannes Hölzl, Jannis Limperg): <a href=\"https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2023/raw/main/hitchhikers_guide.pdf\">https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2023/raw/main/hitchhikers_guide.pdf</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are aware of any other books meeting these criteria (Lean 4 and direct access to an official PDF), please let me know.</p>",

I utilize HTML for expedient reference lookups and PDFs for their reliable search capabilities and offline accessibility. It is my hope that the remaining HTML-exclusive Lean texts (namely, \"The Mechanics of Proof,\" \"Theorem Proving in Lean 4,\" \"The Lean 4 Manual,\" \"Functional Programming in Lean,\" and \"Type Checking in Lean 4\") will also be made available in PDF format in the future.</p>",
