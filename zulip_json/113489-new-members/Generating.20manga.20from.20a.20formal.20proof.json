Despite there is little narrative depth or pictorial beauty, it still helps me to follow the flow of proofs. Reading formal proofs is quite a painful task (as is proof on paper sometimes). It is quite psychologically pleasing to disguise some kind of dialogue element, like teddy bear pair programming or rubber duck debugging.</p>",
