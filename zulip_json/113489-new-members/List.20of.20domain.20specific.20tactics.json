For example similar to omega for natural numbers but for other things. </p>\n<p>More specifically currently I am looking for a tactic for lists which can resolve things like List.toFinset_replicate_of_ne_zero, or automatically construct functions List.toFinset (lst) = {p} -&gt; p \\in lst, etc. Does this exist? </p>\n<p>Another one could be for basic number theory, encapsulating things like primes are &gt;1; prime powers are &gt;1; prime powers have a unique prime factor; etc</p>\n<p>Sorry if I come across as asking for too much--it isn't my intention. I'm more curious what's available rather than making demands</p>",
