One thing I notice is that Lean is actually using much _less_ of my computer resources than I'd prefer; lean is taking about 0.5 GB of RAM and less than 10% of my CPU time, and I really wouldn't mind tripling or quadrupling both of those numbers. Unfortunately, Lean 4 doesn't seem to have a memory limit setting like Lean 3 did. Any other ideas or debugging advice?</p>",
