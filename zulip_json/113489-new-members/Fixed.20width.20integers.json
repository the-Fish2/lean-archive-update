For a long time I have been a supporter of more powerful type systems in programming languages, and Lean seems to go in that direction.<br>\nThat implies that I am interested in using Lean as a programming language. And there is something about this that I find a little odd: I saw unsigned 8, 16, 32, 64 bit integers, but not signed integers.<br>\nIf I understand correctly, the Int type can have virtually unlimited values.</p>\n<p>Is that correct? Is there a workaround to have more CPUI friendly values?</p>\n<p>Thanks a lot</p>",
