I'm not sure if there is a privacy policy that restrict the use of these data. And do I need to crawl the data myself? Or if Zulip offers archived data like arXiv does?</p>",

It seems still need some web crawling work, but it may be easier than directly extract data from Zulip(though Zulip seems offer official API for doing so. I haven't tried.). I hope this page is still under maintenance. I'll use these archived data first.</p>",
