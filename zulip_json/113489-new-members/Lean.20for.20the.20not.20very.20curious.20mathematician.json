What can I point him to, to show him some of the flavor of ITPs in general, or Lean in particular?  \"Lean for the curious mathematician\" is a conference, and I assume he doesn't want to invest that much time.  The natural numbers game comes to mind, but he's not a gamer so terminology like \"boss level\" might turn him off.  Also, it makes it seem like ITPs are for foundations of mathematics level stuff, not even high school or early undergrad level math.</p>\n<p>Is there something else I can point him to?  There are some Quanta magazine articles, but those are very high level and vague to a mathematician, I would assume.</p>",
