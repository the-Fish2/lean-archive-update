This library proposes a deep-embedded, domain-specific formal language, which features dedicated proof commands to automate the synthesis, and the verification, of the technical parts often eluded in the literature. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14485v1\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14485v1</a></p>",
