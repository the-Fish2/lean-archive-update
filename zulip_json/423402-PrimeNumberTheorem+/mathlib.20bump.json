The bump went really well thanks to deprecations (apart from the <code>nat_cast</code> renaming, on which we forgot to add deprecations). And Lean became more powerful at several places (less bugs in typeclass inference, <code>gcongr</code> more powerful), so most fixing was just removing things because the goal was already closed!</p>",
