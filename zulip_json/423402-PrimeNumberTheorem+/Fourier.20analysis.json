The focus for this seminar is on Plancherel's theorem and the (real and complex) interpolation theorems. I think it's mostly disjoint from the Fourier analysis done in PNT+, but it might be good to check that we're not duplicating work. The (at the moment very bare-bones) repository is here: <a href=\"https://github.com/fpvandoorn/BonnAnalysis/\">https://github.com/fpvandoorn/BonnAnalysis/</a></p>",
