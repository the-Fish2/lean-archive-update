But now that we've been doing it for a while in this project, I'd like to record the following. Besides the fact that it greatly helps Copilot to generate Lean from TeX (and vice-versa!), it also makes it 1000 times easier when reorganizing. On quite a few occasions, I've wanted to grab large chunks of code+text and move them around somewhere else in the page, or to another file. Imagine how much more time-consuming/annoying it would be if I had to do this twice, in a coordinated way between two (or four!) separate documents!...</p>",
