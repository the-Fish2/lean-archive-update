(It has happened three times to me in the last few days.) Maybe Zulip should hide the \"resolve\" button in a drop-down menu, or ask for confirmation when it's clicked?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/nzTJOOLRlBB-7g_xGB6-FE3h/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/nzTJOOLRlBB-7g_xGB6-FE3h/image.png\"></a></div>",
