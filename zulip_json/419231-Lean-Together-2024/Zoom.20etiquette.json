Here are the basic Zoom etiquette rules we plan to follow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Please keep your mics muted during talks, unless you've raised your hand and been acknowledged to ask a question.</li>\n<li>But also, please consider keeping your camera on. It's nice to see faces!</li>\n<li>Zoom chat will be restricted to hosts and speakers. If you want to discuss a particular talk (live or afterward), use a thread on Zulip. We'll use a new topic for each talk, and hope there will be lots of discussion.</li>\n<li>Most talks will be 30 minutes: 25 for the speaker, and 5 for questions after. Some speakers may take questions during the talk, but by default, please save your questions for the end. We have a packed schedule and really want to stay on time.</li>\n</ul>",
