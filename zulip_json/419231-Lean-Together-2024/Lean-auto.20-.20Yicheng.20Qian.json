For example, in our recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02949\">Graph2Tac paper</a> for Coq, discussed in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"219941\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/219941-Machine-Learning-for-Theorem-Proving/topic/Announcing.20Graph2Tac.2C.20a.20prover.20based.20on.20Tactician.27s.20new.20API\">#Machine Learning for Theorem Proving &gt; Announcing Graph2Tac, a prover based on Tactician's new API</a>, we do a careful comparison of our AI theorem prover against CoqHammer.  (See Figures 5 and 6 in the results section.)  Similarly, a few papers compare against SledgeHammer in Isabelle.  It seems that AI-based solvers are quickly catching up and beating hammers, and it would be worth more discussion on how to combine the two approaches better.  (Of course, the real test is how these systems do in practice and that is as much about their strength as it is useability factors like ease of installation.)</p>",
