There have been several false starts, that failed for various reasons. Everytime, my idea was that writing a paper (that would have a larger set of authors) should be done by a small group of people. But this has not worked out so far.</p>\n<p>After discussing with Adam and Patrick (who also worked on the latest version), we have decided that we want to try a different approach, inspired by the authoring process of the odd order paper (about which Cyril Cohen told me a few weeks ago).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want to have a private stream, for discussions about the paper.</li>\n<li>Everyone who contributed to LTE may request access to this stream. (Please DM me.)</li>\n<li>We shall probably have regular zoom meetings to (biweekly?) in addition to the zulip discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nJohan (on behalf of Adam and Patrick)</p>",
