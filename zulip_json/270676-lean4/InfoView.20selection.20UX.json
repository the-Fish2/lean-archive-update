I noticed while watching new users that this workflow is rather confusing because the difference with regular “highlighting selection” is not clear. Would it be possible to prevent regular selection? It probably cannot be a permanent things because people use regular selection to copy-paste from the infoView (especially since the copy-paste menu is broken). But ideally widgets could disable it (or at least there would be an extension settings). <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"221921\">@Marc Huisinga</span></p>",
