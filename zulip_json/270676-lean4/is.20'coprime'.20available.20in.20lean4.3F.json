But I found this method in <a href=\"https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Std/Data/Nat/Gcd.html\">Documentation</a>.  I thought maybe it has something to do with the white color of the outer frame of this method in Documentation. After all, I would like to know if it is possible to use the coprime method, and if so, do I need to add a new library or something?</p>",
