I would like to create a snippet which for example automates \"rcases $1 with \\\\&lt; $2, $3 \\\\&gt;\".<br>\nThe problem is that the above snippet doesn't work. Instead of the lean4 symbol \\&lt; for bracket I instead get literally \\&lt;.<br>\nDoes any one know how to automate the insertion of Lean 4 special symbols?</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance,<br>\nOmar</p>\n<p>Edit: I found it. I will keep it in case any one wonders how to do it. One needs to use unicode symbol inside the snippet code .<br>\nFor example one uses ‚ü© instead of \\\\&gt;</p>",
