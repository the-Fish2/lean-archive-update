        "content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/436\">better setup diagnostics PR</a> was recently merged into vscode-lean4 and has been added to a new pre-release (0.0.145). It adds new warnings and errors to the VS Code extension that are displayed when potential issues are detected with the user's Lean 4 setup and provides a new command ('Troubleshooting: Show Setup Information') to dump all kinds of context information about the user's setup to make it easier to debug setup issues, especially here on Zulip. The details of what exactly is checked by the extension are in the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/436\">PR description</a>. All warning-level setup notifications can be disabled using the 'Lean4: Show Setup Warnings' setting.</p>\n<p>It's possible that the new error-level diagnostics may cause issues for users with exotic Lean 4 setups. If you think that this applies to you (e.g.: Nix users, corporate users, users from China, ...), please read the <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/vscode-lean4/pull/436\">PR description</a> carefully and install the pre-release as described below. If this PR is causing issues for you, please let me know.</p>\n<p>To facilitate these changes, another major rewrite of the VS Code extension was needed. It is likely that it still contains bugs, so I would greatly appreciate if people from the Lean community could help me test it. If you already opted-in to vscode-lean4 pre-releases in the past, you don't need to do anything and VS Code will automatically upgrade to the pre-release. Otherwise, you can opt-in to pre-releases here:<br>\n<a href=\"user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\">Installing a pre-release</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\" title=\"Installing a pre-release\"><img src=\"user_uploads/3121/hiAMkTs8YFi6Axxcr9xOrSbS/image.png\"></a></div><h3>Dumping setup information</h3>\n<p>Here's an example of the kind of setup information that the 'Troubleshooting: Show Setup Information' command can provide:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/dYgkQeDfJwG7uVMq0jHrZi7z/image.png\">'Show Setup Information' command</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/3121/dYgkQeDfJwG7uVMq0jHrZi7z/image.png\" title=\"'Show Setup Information' command\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/3121/dYgkQeDfJwG7uVMq0jHrZi7z/image.png\"></a></div><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Linux (release: 6.8.8-300.fc40.x86_64)<br>\n<strong>CPU architecture</strong>: x64<br>\n<strong>CPU model</strong>: 8 x Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz<br>\n<strong>Available RAM</strong>: 16.44 GB</p>\n<p><strong>Curl installed</strong>: true<br>\n<strong>Git installed</strong>: true<br>\n<strong>Elan</strong>: Reasonably up-to-date (version: 3.1.1)<br>\n<strong>Lean</strong>: Reasonably up-to-date (version: 4.7.0)<br>\n<strong>Project</strong>: Valid Lean project (path: /home/mhuisi/Lean4Test16)</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Elan toolchains</strong>: </p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">installed</span> <span class=\"n\">toolchains</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">--------------------</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">leanprover</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean4</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">stable</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">default</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">leanprover</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean4</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">v4.7.0</span>\n<span class=\"n\">leanprover</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean4</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">v4.8.0</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">rc1</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">active</span> <span class=\"n\">toolchain</span>\n<span class=\"c1\">----------------</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">leanprover</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean4</span><span class=\"o\">:</span><span class=\"n\">v4.7.0</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">overridden</span> <span class=\"kd\">by</span> <span class=\"bp\">'/</span><span class=\"n\">home</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">mhuisi</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">Lean4Test16</span><span class=\"bp\">/</span><span class=\"n\">lean</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">toolchain'</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">Lean</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">version</span> <span class=\"mi\">4</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">7</span><span class=\"bp\">.</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">x86_64</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">unknown</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">linux</span><span class=\"bp\">-</span><span class=\"n\">gnu</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">commit</span> <span class=\"mi\">6</span><span class=\"n\">fce8f7d5cd1</span><span class=\"o\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Release</span><span class=\"o\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div>",
