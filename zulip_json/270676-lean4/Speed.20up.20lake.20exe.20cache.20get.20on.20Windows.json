There are many similarities between the lake cache and the problems in that video (copying many small files, anti-virus makes the problem worse, ...), but there seem to be quite a lot of tips to improve the situation (and that also improved the performance on NFS). I do not have the technical knowledge to know which ones do and do not apply to the lake cache.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"qbKGw8MQ0i8\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbKGw8MQ0i8\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/fea58a9b02f4b28f423177b113f36ff914fb9e2c/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f71624b4777384d513069382f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
