Furthermore as Terence Tao has noted it allows larger scale collaborative mathematical projects than is usually possible just on paper. For computer science applications its mostly about the absolute certainty as projects are usually already large and collaborative.</p>\n<p>The overhead is that you have to...well deal with the pickiness of a computer system like Lean, if you are willing to do that to achieve the benefits its worth it.</p>\n<p>This is of course disregarding factors like Lean simply not supporting a use case such as Homotopy Type Theory.</p>",

You can't really make much sense of the question unless you have some baseline. For me as a professional mathematician Bourbaki and the proof of FLT and the Stacks Project are all very useful, for entirely different reasons, and Lean is also useful in my professional career.</p>",
