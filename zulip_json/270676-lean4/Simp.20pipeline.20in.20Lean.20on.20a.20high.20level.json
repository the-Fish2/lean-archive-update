One inspiration for this feature was that they exist in Lean where you can parametrise a simproc by an up or down arrow. During this project I was wondering how the simp pipeline in Lean looks like on a high level and which consideration went into the design of the pipeline?</p>\n<p>For reference, Isabelle starts descending into the term during a top-down phase and then proceeds symmetrically with a bottom-up phase:</p>\n<p><strong>Top-down</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>congruence rules</li>\n<li>(<strong>new</strong>) top-down simprocs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bottom-up</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>rewrite rules</li>\n<li>conditional rewrite rules</li>\n<li>bottom-up simprocs</li>\n<li>solver</li>\n<li>looper</li>\n</ul>",
