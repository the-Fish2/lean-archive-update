Currently I'm calling the apply tactic by just referring directly to it's implementation like this:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Lean\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">let</span> <span class=\"n\">vars</span> <span class=\"bp\">‚Üê</span> <span class=\"n\">goal.apply</span> <span class=\"o\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Expr.const</span> <span class=\"bp\">``</span><span class=\"n\">Classical.byContradiction</span> <span class=\"o\">[])</span>\n<span class=\"n\">setGoals</span> <span class=\"n\">vars</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I guess this is fine for now, but is this the best way? For example, I'm now passing the empty list to const, is that okay, or fragile? I'd like to express my intention as high-level as possible, so I was wondering if there is a more concise syntax for calling an already existing tactic. The macro_rules syntax looks great but I need to inspect the local state and do some logic on that, so it will probably quickly be too limiting.</p>",
