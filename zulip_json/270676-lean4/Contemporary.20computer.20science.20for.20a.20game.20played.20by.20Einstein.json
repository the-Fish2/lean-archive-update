Do you use a supercomputer to demonstrate my following conjecture by quoting me? \"Hex never ends in a tie (preventing the opponent from creating a winning chain means to create one for your own): artificial intelligence discovers the winning strategy on an arbitrary-sized board by dabbing the opponent near where he has just played and understanding how templates reported at <a href=\"https://www.drking.org.uk/hexagons/hex/templates.html\">https://www.drking.org.uk/hexagons/hex/templates.html</a> are repeated periodically.\" If there is not hardware powerful enough to demonstrate the conjecture do you at least use a supercomputer to completely walk through the game tree part (simple theory of games concept) related to a box on the board with the 4 sides 9 hexagons long depicted at <a href=\"http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/hex/\">http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~hayward/hex/</a>?<br>\nDoes an artificial intelligence make my conjecture concerning Hex get into the Langlands program (if it is not a part of it)?</p>",
