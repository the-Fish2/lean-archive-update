I'm just doing this because in my translation project from Lean -&gt; Dedukti I'll need to find a solution for how to encode proof irrelevance, so in the meantime I just wanted to see what subset of constants I can feasibly translate (and possibly patch others using axioms for the time being). I guess I should have explained that hahaha</p>",
