Colabo has had to give up its commissioned activities, and is now supported by volunteers.<br>\nMany people still believe in the hoax.<br>\nThe other is a slander against Horiguchi Hidetoshi, a male international student at King's College London.<br>\nHe became a target of Himasora Akane because he criticized Himasora Akane for suddenly making sexist slurs against Higashino Atsuko, a female political scientist.<br>\nSince then, he has been subjected to fierce bullying by Himasora Akane and her supporters, who have spread false rumors about him being a nuisance customer at a sex club, etc., and have stabbed him with a pencil and turned him into a needle pile on the game, until he attempted suicide.<br>\nThe attacks continue to this day, and his life continues to be disrupted.<br>\nI have seen these events and severely damaged my psyche.<br>\nMany of Kotonoha Akane's fans have expressed their grief over these events.<br>\nAmong them, I was so shocked that I could hardly go to university or work part-time anymore, let alone engage in fan activities for synthetic voice characters, including Kotonoha Akane.<br>\nI have sent many petitions to AI, Inc., the copyright holder of Kotonoha Akane, and pleaded at the head office.<br>\nDespite these efforts, AI, Inc. has not taken any action against Kotonoha Akane to date.<br>\nSo, I started the petition to get A.I.
