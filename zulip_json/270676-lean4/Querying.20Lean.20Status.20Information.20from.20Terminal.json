I'm interested in finding a way to extract this information through a terminal command. Specifically, I'm looking to retrieve details on grammar errors and the results from #check commands in my .lean files via the terminal.</p>\n<p>Could anyone guide me on how to achieve this? Any pointers or commands that could help me access this Lean status information from the terminal would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Thank you! (Moreover, like Albert Jiang provided a PISA (Portal to ISAbelle) to help automatically test in Isabelle, I was wondering if there is any similar tool in lean4?)</p>",
