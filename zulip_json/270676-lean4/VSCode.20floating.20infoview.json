Unfortunately, it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> due to a technical limitation, moving a webview-based editor between windows requires the contents of that editor to reload. It is then up to the editor to restore the state you had previously accumulated. In some cases your state might be reset, as if you had opened the editor for the first time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and indeed it appears that moving the infoview causes it to permanently get stuck in the initial \"Waiting for Lean server to start...\" state. So it seems some work is needed on the extension side to make sure that the state is properly reloaded, cc: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"221921\">@Marc Huisinga</span></p>",
