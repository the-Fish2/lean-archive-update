From <a href=\"https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/releases?page=2\">here</a>, it seems like September 7, 2023 is when Lean4 was officially released. However, there are a lot of versions before 4.0.0. Does this mean that all versions before it (despite not being official) were publicly available? I'm trying to figure out where or not there is any possibility that GPT-3.5 was trained on Lean4 syntax, which would only be possible if the pre official release versions were publicly available before early 2022.</p>",
