In the past, I've installed Ocaml, Coq, Python, and other things via <code>conda</code>.  It works pretty well by providing a virtual environment in which I can install things and nuke them when I'm done.  (Docker and other containers are not an option, unfortunately.)  Most things I can <code>brew install</code> or <code>apt-get install</code> I can also <code>conda install</code>.  <strong>How might I install Lean in a conda environment?</strong>.  (Also, I know how to do vs code remotely already in this system and I'm also fine just running elan/lean/lake from the command line for my purposes.)</p>",
