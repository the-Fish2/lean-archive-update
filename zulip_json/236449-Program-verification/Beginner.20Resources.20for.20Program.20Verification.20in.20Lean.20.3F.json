Perhaps the hitchhiker's guide <a href=\"https://github.com/blanchette/logical_verification_2021/raw/main/hitchhikers_guide.pdf\">#hglv</a> (lean3) is useful? For the most part, proving theorems about programs is no different from any other kind of theorems in lean. There are some ideas for having a more streamlined experience in this situation but they have not yet materialized. But you can still reason about the definition of a function by cases or induction, use <code>split</code> liberally to break up match statements and so on. This is how most of the program verification theorems in Batteries are proved</p>",

Anyway, I want to explore the possibilities of teaching a  follow-up course about verification of programs in Lean.</p>",
